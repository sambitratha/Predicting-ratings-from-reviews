This is one my must have books. It is a masterpiece of spirituality. I'll be the first to admit, its literary quality isn't much. It is rather simplistically written, but the message behind it is so powerful that you have to read it. It will take you to enlightenment.

I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60's. The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60's. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future.Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word. I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here. It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through.

A timeless classic.  It is a very demanding and assuming title, but Gibran backs it up with some excellent style and content.  If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion.From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it.  It is a messege.  A guide book.  A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma.  There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.  I loved the cover.

Reading this made my mind feel like a still pool of water, cool and quiet in a mossy grotto.  It's direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in, leaving you at peace.  It is best to set time aside for it, relax, absorb, and let it softly clear your mind.

An amazing work. Realizing extensive use of Biblical imagery and sentence structure, &#34;The Prophet&#34; by Khalil Gibran is a literary classic. Influencing the Free Love movement of the 1960's, Gibran's master work explores themes of love, longing and loss.

When I was in college in the 70's this book had a revival and I did not read it then.  Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.  But as you can see from the example, what he says is not religious, but positive ways of looking at things.  Since I rediscoverd the book I have given away many copies and everyone I have given it to sincerly thanked me.

I discovered The Prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then.  Now, in addition to my beat up hard copy, I have a portable e-copy.  If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed (pun intended) book of spiritual guidance, this would be it.  It doesn't care how you picture, name or define &#34;God&#34; or whether you give him a gender and a personality.  It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others.  If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.  Looking back, I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand, but because I did not want to hear gently spoken, intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own.  Now, if I could have only one book, this would probably be it.

In my opinion, it is just one of the most beautiful literature pieces ever written. Would recommend to as a gift for anyone spiritual/poetic/philosophy/educational piece or just something to enjoy here and there. 5 stars for sure!

I have the 1972 version, bought in 1974. The 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but my dust jacket is long gone. This particular rendition has had many re-printings, for a reason: it's very popular. The textured paper, old-style typography, and leather cover are better than a plain-old paperback. The size is diminutive, which is perfect for this book.

Anything I've read by Gibran is, in my mind, flawless. This, the most famous of his works, is no exception. It is simple, yet deep; honest and profound; moving and inspirational. Gibran's work is one of a kind, and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self-help program or therapy or anything like that. The poetic style, the aphorisms, the parables, the almost biblical feel, are all just what over-worked, over-stressed, modern and spiritually starved worldly people need.

Cool book, I really like the quality of the production.  Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper, looks to be cotton rag.  I am proud to include it in my collection.  Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living. Very readable, the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed. It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life.  The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus.  I give it 5 stars. I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end...and then start over for that matter.  Excellent for busy people or commuters!

I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.

The utterings are omni - religious and subtly explain the basic principles  of the human lifespan from an authoritative and spiritual perspective. A must- have for any deep or not-so-deep thinker.

Maybe some of the folks in his homeland considered him a &#34;prophet,&#34; but I see him as an other person with some ideas but not too many truths. That being said, I like many of his ideas and concepts. If you like spiritual gurus like Eckhardt Tolle you'll probably like Kahlil Gibran.

This is one of the first (literary) books I recall reading. My mother kept a collection of Gibran's works that she often read. I was curious to see what attracted her, so I looked into them too ( I was either eight or nine  at the time). I believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what I was being force-fed by nuns in  catechism class. Rereading Gibran now, I'm struck by the notion that Hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote Siddhartha. They  contain many of the same themes: No one else can guide you on your path.  You must select your own course. Preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen.  True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books. They may appear simplistic to the jaundiced eye, but they may also  provide the inspiration you need to see you through life's travails.

It is a great reminder for what's most important in life and puts everything in perspective.  My favorite 'chapters' are Love, Marriage, Children and The first look. I am a romantic though, so the other chapters may appeal to you more....;-)  Absolutely classic and timeless.  Perfectly stands the test of time. My personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures.

This is Gibran's most celebrated work and it is so with goodreason.  It is a profound insight and expose into the human characterand the emotions that work within the heart and soul.  Humble words,seared with the heights and depths of love and of pain, this is a life-changing arrangement of words.  If I had to sum the book up in one word, it would be &quot;SUBLIME.&quot; If you're picking up this title, be sure to order Gibran's 'The Beloved' to go along with it. These are books that deserve a worthy and permanent place on your bookshelf.

Intrinsically, this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author. While, personally, I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book, I did find it, simply a pleasure to read. Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany, the style of the book in its fluid manner, the parallel structure of the chapters, and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece, leave the reader, whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not, in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time. As, really, they probably have not, it really did not waste my time anyway; it only took a little over an hour to read (with breaks).

When I first started writing poetry at age 12 or 13, I was encouraged to read other poets.  Something I refused to do because I thought it might influence, "My Style"...:)OK, so I was hard headed...  I later was introduced by a Brother In Law to Kahlil Gibran and it was like finding a kindred soul.  I now totally encourage any one that want's to excel in poetry to read the greats.  And you won't find many of the caliber of this man!!!  His words sing from the page both in his poetry and in his short stories!  I love "Martyr's To Man"  (It's been a while but some of the words are still singed in my brain...  And I think it truly speaks of the time we are living in now more than ever...  From memory so not verbatim...Are you a soldier?Who must forsake wife and children?And go fourth into the fields of battle?For the sake of greedWhich your leaders miscall duty?Than you are a martyr to man!There's more but the gist of what I am saying is if you love poetry and you haven't read any Kahlil Gibran you're missing out on one of the greatest poets to ever live!And if you write poetry, I firmly believe Kahlil Gibran should be recquired reading!!!Not that you will feel you have to plod your way through it...You too, will fall in love with his immense gifts!!!Sincerely,And best wishes to allChase vonYour Chance to Hear The Last Panther Speak

This book was great; each chapter was a nugget of wisdom, resulting in a treasure trove by the end. It's no wonder this book is called a classic. Gibran uses a literary style inspired by the Bible, but it is still easy to read. Has a lot of philosophical ideas that I'm sure I will revisit in the future. Seems like one of those books that you learn something new every time you reread it. Definitely recommend, especially for anyone new to philosophy reading because it is short and easy to read.

A decade past, I knew very little about the writer/artist/poet/prophet, Kahlil Gibran. I am happy to say, that today, I am well acquainted with his work. The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a "story," but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait.

The Prophet is Kahlil Gibran's best known work in the western world with over 25 million copies sold. It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the "strange little book" or "the little black book" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was "The Counsels" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as "the poet-prophet par-excellence" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, "extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern." Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature. And in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves. Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper. It is the most loving book ever written."I can add little more than that...other than Haskell had a very good point.

Gibran Khalil Gibran was born in 1883 in what is now Northern Lebanon.  In 1909 he went to Paris to study, but he did not like the strict education, and so he traveled, eventually moving to New York.  Gibran became both an artist and a writer, and in 1923 he published "The Prophet", which is generally considered to be his greatest work.  He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48.The Prophet is a story about Almustafa (The Prophet) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home.  Before he goes, a group of people stop him, and to them he teaches the secrets of life.  Gibran writes in a very poetic manner, and it is wonderful to read.

I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this. I knew only that it was a well-regarded book, and that it was said to be full of wisdom.What I found was a story that was easy to read. There are few words per page, covering the sayings of a wise man as he speaks to those around him. There is a kind of poetry in the words, but not the kind that is difficult to understand. The insights were both familiar and refreshing. It made me reconsider my notions of all aspects of life, although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening.I bought the hardcover. It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters. Throughout the book are scattered drawings that Kahlil Gibran made. I like them. I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god. Gibran says, "... the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks, than to the least of all the blades of grass." (pp 27-28)  The notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a pervasive connectedness or oneness with nature and the universe.

As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled "The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude," I appreciate any book that opens the doors to spiritual understanding. There are few contemporary books that will do this for you in such a poetic way.This is a book containing eternal truths. It was given to me as a high school graduation present many years ago. At the time, I found it beautiful, but I couldn't understand it. That is because I hadn't experienced life.Selections from this book were read at my wedding. The sections on love speak of what it is truly about. Most of us never have an inkling of what true love is since we are caught up in a world of attachment to illusions and delusions. This book will help you to break through them.This is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the Bible has done. Kahlil Gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith.The book is filled with metaphors and parables. It is almost as if Jesus himself is speaking through the author. Whether or not you will be able to comprehend what the author is speaking about, The Prophet will plant seeds that can bear good fruit.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of "The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude"

" When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow is that giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight."  G. K. Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description "divinely inspired."  Brian Bruya"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own."

Okay I know that Gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60's.It does not mean that he also isn't still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about. The set up is simple - as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years, he is asked a series of questions, "tell us of friendship, of love, of work, of death". And to each question the prophet provides an answer.For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow.But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet. Read and take your own message from his words.

I received my first copy of this book over 40 years ago.  As a young woman, I found understanding in topics that concerned me; as I aged, my life experiences broadened and this book still gave me understanding and confirmation.I have given this gift to many and they, too, enjoy the book and keep it as a reference.This is a book that keeps on giving what you need as your life experiences or interests change.

The prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a very beautiful, inspiring writing which really resonated within me, it felt as truth. I feel that with good patience and deep contemplation, this book can lead you to a profound understanding of your own life and all others around you.I first read about Kahlil Gibran in a book calledThe Lost Teachings of Atlantis. That book answered all my spiritual questions about the meaning of Life, who and what we are and more in a very easily understandable manner and all of it corresponds with the writing of Kahlil Gibran. I HIGHLY recommend reading that book also.

_The Prophet_ is a short read (my copy checks in at just under 100 pages), but its berevity belies both the power and beauty of Gibran's words.  At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter "Love", Gibran writes, "... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ..."  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading "The Prophet" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my "human-ness" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.  Undeniably readers will have a visceral reaction (although, apparently given the reviews of some, not all reactions are positive.)  Highly recommended, if only to cause one to examine their own life.  After all, "the unexamined life is not worth living."

The Prophet is about a mysterious religious thinker who is about to leave for his native land.  Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want.

I plan to buy 3 more copies from Amazon, for my departing son & distant friends.Last night, I made a mad dash to get a copy of this book, ten minutes before the book store closed; because I couldn't find my old one.  I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.  But don't be so easily deceived, because this book packs more useful information than any 50-pound college textbook, without the endless verbage of a 1,000 page Russian novel.It is small, the paper of good weight and quality (the ones I always purchase, at least), the print is big and the illustrations done by Mr. Gibran are simple yet humana and divinical.  The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.  I was first given this book by a friend, as a departing gift for a 7,000 land/sea voyage, back in 1983.I hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me.  I sent this book to him as my comforting presence.

Echoing the reviews of others - it is obvious that Gibran both was inspired by and inspired many of the great writers of all ages.  From Buddha to Coehlo, and countless others in between, there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that, once lifted, opens the mind, heart and soul to universal wisdom.It is not hard to understand why Gibran was as popular in his day, and in the 1960's, as he was.  Covering the landscape from religion to love, Gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the Prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey.  The metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional.The book itself is nearly 100 pages, but the content is not readable at any level rapidly.  This book is one that bears constant revival and renewal.  It's a well that provides the reader with sweet water of wisdom which merits frequent draws to slake the thirst.A must have and a must read.

I opened the the cover and saw that Grandma had lent it out to her friends and they all had signed it. One person who had signed it was my Mom, who had died years before before my Grandma.

These days, Kahlil Gibran's "The Prophet" often gets dismissed as "hippie" literature. Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. "It Must be a cult," he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics ("On Love", "On Work", "On Joy and Sorrow", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem "On Children" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, "Breaths.""Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you."At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a "middle ground" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in "unwinding" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of "The Prophet" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's "Search Inside" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with. Chances are, you will find something that speaks to you on some level.

When Gibran was first introduced to me, I had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary, grab a dictionary sort of read. But when you first open to those sections that apply to you, and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears, well, shock is the only word for it. Yes, the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in 'The Prophet' may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned, but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed, unique. I've purchased countless copies to the ones that I know will love and understand his words. And if for nothing else, Kahlil's work can be labeled as truly, a literary work of art.

The language is poetic, but it is not poetry.  It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  "Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'"Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all "cosmic" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: "He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked."Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this "It Takes a Village" gem: "And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all."  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  "The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured."  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of "The Prophet" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'"Forget that Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole "one source, many wells" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  "Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!"  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of "love thy neighbor" philosophy, it still defines "good" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a "do unto others" prescription, but "You are good when you are one with yourself."If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, "Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit."  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path ("a truth") to God:"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek."Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  "You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!"  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism ("You are good when you are one with yourself," if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of "The Prophet."  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that "The Prophet" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that "The Prophet" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word "hedon."  "Hedonist" sounds like a philosophical school, as does "epicurean."  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)

This book is almost as if Kahlil Gibran took the pains and joys of millions of people and somehow managed to encapsulate all these wonders in this one book.  In his own unique manner, Gibran has explored every facet  of human existence.  Although the book has a sacred charm to it, there is a  universal appeal that should allow anyone of any religious persuassion  enjoy this gem of a book. I wouldn't be surprised if a few hundred years  from now some theologians unearth this book and conclude that it was a  bible of our times.

Certainly the words are of Kahlil Gibran, but the eternally PRESENT divine wisdom told through his words is from the source of all sources. Only those who are ready to receive the divine wisdom are destined to read and know the meaning behind the meanings of his words. This is one of the five most valued books that I keep on refering again and again for solace and peace of MYSELF.While writing - or rather while being an instrument to write this book - Kahlil Gibran must have reached the original source of all the knowledge and wisdom available to humankind.Gibran's book is music, poetry, wisdom and truth - all at the same time!I salute Kahlil Gibran for giving us the &quot;THE PROPHET&quot;.

I usually don't like getting books that I did not ask for. When someone buys a book for me, there is a certain obligation to actually read it, but doing so takes away time from the books I really want to read. There are so many books on my reading list and so little time to read them all that getting an unasked-for book feels like someone actually stealing from me: stealing valuable reading time.In the case of *The Prophet,* however, I did not resent the choice of my benefactor, even though I had not asked for it.First of all, it was a very quick read, consisting of twenty-nine poetic speeches by the fictional "prophet." He delivers them as his last word on various topics, since he is about to head back home after having lived in a foreign city for twelve years, and the people ask him to speak on all the important issues that touch on human life: family, food, work, emotions, economics, social problems, art, morality, spirituality, death, etc.On most of these issues, the prophet takes what might be called an Eastern stance. He stresses the importance of "letting go" rather than "taking charge," whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts. For whatever your own worldview, a degree of "letting go" is an art we can all learn.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofJob's Wager: An Alternative to Pascal's Wager and the Atheist's Wager (With Color Illustrations)

I loved it the first time I read it and I have given several copies away to friends/family who have lost someone they loved or had a problem I thought the book could help them with. I have 2 copies at home now and I often refer to it. A book you won't want to part with.

This book is poetic myth,a work of beauty,whose every word drips a truth,and a thought of knowledge.Reading it is like swimming in realitybut a reality I have not known,till now.Kahlil Kahlil Gibran knew something we did not,he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity.Though this is merely the preaching of a Prophet,Gibran is able to turn it into story,and I feel from the gut for all the characters.The Prophet is unsurpassed in form,in content best when speaking of beauty,in ways I had never known,and weakest when speaking of prayer.Certainly Gibran relies on the story of Jesus,and throughout there are allusions to his wordsand actions.But this is a new prophet,who speaks the words of old,though it be in new wineskin.

I would buy from this seller again.Kahlil Gibran was a genius. "The Prophet" uses a lot of old English, but is still an easy/quick read. I can see why this book has been translated into dozens of different languages. - Definitely words to live by. A poet.

This book was recommended to me by a friend. What he told me of it is that, just as The Art of War, this is the book from which you take out whatever you want. What you find in it depends as much on the book as it does on you. It speaks of love, life and people in the most touching way ever. I have it in my handbag at all times. When I first read it, I cried. There is literally something mystical about it. I like to think I took a lot out of it. One of those books you should read again and again and again..

I was in my twenties when I first read The Prophet.  I am now 65.  The Prophet has grown in the depth of its content as I have been able to understand more deeply.  This book, I believe, has the meaning of the holy writings of all the great religions.  As you read, decide if all these writings do hold the same great truths.

I read it in an hour. Kahlil Gibran is definitely the people's philosopher. The book itself seems to be written on impulse, and the author knows what the modern world is looking for. The context is powerful and sensitive, and more than anything it's the truth.

Reading a classic such as &quot;The Prophet&quot; is much more fruitful when it is revisited often, the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her.Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran, listening to him speak.  The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer.Listen, embrace and breathe in these words.Open your mind and heart to The Prophet.

Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for a heavily poetic book on one man's life philosophies, but this book lost me after the chapter on children. Some sections are insightful and very well written. On death, children, and love were my favorites. I'm not sure how novel these ideas were back in 1928 (?) when the book was first published, but they are nothing new today. Still, the flowery language is pretty, it's not overly long, and also it's probably one of those books that make you look cool when your reading it at a coffee shop.... so it's not all bad.This book was given to me by my dad who grew up in the 60's and 70's. It occurs to me that The Prophet seems to speak best to those from this generation (peace, love, and all that crap... you know). Maybe it's just not relevant to me? Maybe I need to approach it at a different time? Maybe I need to smoke something herbal?

Gibran gets right down to the bedrock of what it is all about.  He was obviously a very enlightened man, and The Prophet is so completely, psychologically and spiritually healthy. Anyone who would not consider this work a standard for healthy living, is simply simple-minded.  This book should be offered to all high school students as a guide in gaining perspective on what is really important in life.  I first read The Prophet about 10 years ago, and I typically read it about once a year, just to remind myself.  However, I gave my copy to my son who showed signs of being &quot;at risk&quot; at age 17.  I believe the book had a significant, positive impact on him, and he is now 20 and living a very responsible and balanced life.  After my son had read this book, I found him on the telephone one evening reading passages to a friend.  It made him think, and any time you can get a teenager to think, it's a very good thing.

Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), the Lebanese-American poet and mystic never wrote anything finer than this 1923 volume, his masterwork. Had he written nothing before or beyond THE PROPHET, he would still be remembered into perpetuity.Each brief chapter of THE PROPHET addresses an aspect of the human condition, including Love, Marriage, Work, Pleasure, Buying and Selling, Children, Eating and Drinking, to name but a few. Gibran espouses no particular religious, ethical or moral system, and yet includes them all in this slim tome, written it seems, with a quill of light, not ink.A Higher Power (by whatever name you may call it) spoke through Gibran in the writing, a perfect letter to the ages, and an ultimate expression of Humanity.

My father has this huge book collection and I remember I was around 12 when I found this book amidst a sea of books and I thought it was pretty small, so I read it in one sit...It changed my life.It talks about life, love, friendship, death, etc. All of these answers that you spend your entire life searching for...are in this book. It tells you all of these things that you already know about life, but somehow we keep in the back of our heads so we don't have to do the right thing, as if ignoring them will make us more human by default. There is no place that I go that this book doesn't follow me.I remember in college having this teacher that I despised so much and the class was talking about their favorite book and when it came my turn I said "The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran" and she got all excited too and said "That's my favorite book too, it's like my Bible"...I remember thinking "How can I have something that is so important to me in common with someone that I despise?"...I guess that's the thing about life...I will never forget that or her...

This book takes different themes such as work, love, etc. and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man, who seems to be spirit talking. He is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embracement of all dark and light. He is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his openess and aliveness. He wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity. This can be read in a variety of ways coming from each person's belief system. I read this when I was in a state of loss, loss of so much. This book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time. It can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings. I most definately recommend this book, for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life.

A prophet has waited twelve years in a coastal town for the ship that will bear him back to his homeland, which he misses.Why he is there, why he is waiting, how he knows what he knows, and who he is is a mystery.  As he departs the townspeople gather to wish him well. A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.  Written 2,500 years ago, and one of the most translated books in the world.  The Tao contains many principles you can use in your everyday life, and if you're not thinking in  ego based ways, your wisdom based thinking opens up..If you like one book, you will love the other, so I recommend both.  For the Tao, I recommend the Stephen Mitchell version.  Hope this was useful.

Everyone carries an omnificent quality within themselves.  Some individuals have not grasped this concept.  Some individuals do not realize that a simple change can create a huge transformation.  Would you ask an important figure for advice before she or he left town?  Their advice would be elements about life that you already knew, but seemingly forgot. There are simple fundamentals to follow that can make you a better person within your own eyes.Gibran uses The Prophet Almustafa to enlighten readers with simple tactics they can use to live a more pure and genuine life.  How many of us love, go to work, have clothes, feel pain, and own friendships?  You do not have to be religious to appreciate this book.  Gibran's classic takes common stress factors that everyone can relate to, and shares guidance on how to simplify it in your life:  "When you work with love, you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another" ( p. 26).  Read this book and share it.  Think about the most valuable portion to you in this book. Share that portion with another person.

Since I first read The Prophet when I was a teenager I have had a copy by my side.  It is a gift of such value in comprehending the depth and meaning of this wonderful Life in its beauty of every relationship that engages us.  Be it work, parenting, eating, death or love, Gibran paints word images of such divine and exquisite loveliness that, once read, will change the reader's perspective forever.  It is a book to refer to again and again as life unfolds and offers new opportunities for spiritual growth and awareness.It is a book I have given as a gift to many young people as they grapple with the frustrations and distortions of an often incomprehensible outer world.  It is a book of beautiful truths and a map to our own seeking souls.  I particularly love this edition which includes Gibran's original drawings.

I have been reading The Prophet every year for over a decade. Or intending to. It's an incredible read. If I'm having issues in my life, I read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat. It is a divinely inspired piece of work, and can be read in one setting. There is pretty much nothing that he doesn't cover in the book that can't be related to your own life. I bought the ebook version so I could have easier access. It's a book for everyone.

I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books.  The Prophet is my favorite.  Several of the  &quot;poems&quot; or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life.  The  book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others.  There is  barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage,  death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life.  This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough  time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives.  The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time  goes on.The drawings add to an already great work.  At my favorite Lebanese  restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran.

I first read this book as a teenager. It has remained on my bookshelf, being read many, many times. I have given it as a gift to several people, over the years. It is one of my favourite books.The Prophet is a classic, and is considered to be Kahlil Gibran's masterpiece. Gibran himself considered it his "greatest achievement". Originally published in 1923, it has been translated into 28 languages, and is still a popular piece of literature today.The book is a beautiful blend of poetry and philosophy. Each chapter takes on a particular topic, or aspect of life. "The Prophet" speaks on love, work, law, freedom, pain, time, and many other important issues we all deal with as we journey through life. Each beautifully written chapter is also illustrated by Gibran.The importance and beauty of this book is immeasurable and timeless. This book should be on every bookshelf of those who truly enjoy the beauty of poetry and classic literature, to be enjoyed and appreciated by every generation. The life lessons offered by Kahlil Gibran are timeless in essence and belief.

This is an amazingly beautiful book.  The writings are spiritual and absolutely beautiful.  They cover almost every aspect of life and provide inspiring, poetic and though-provoking words in answer to questions raised about them.  When my mother passed away, I read this book over and over again.  Many use the chapter on marriage as part of their wedding vows.  My daughter asked me to read that chapter to her and her husband as part of their wedding ceremony.  I cannot think of a better way to spend $10.00.  You will more than get your money's worth even if you only read one chapter in the book.

Gibran wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it. the importance of each relationship. The book was written to be relatable to every reader, all the subjects are mondain. The availability of this book is a great advantage that I don't think people are aware of. It's an hour long to read, but a lifetime to understand, if you read it you'll remember it in every new life matter or relationship.Buy it and keep it on the shelve for reference, it's an answer to everything. and read it carefully.

Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines. I recommend this book to anyone, even if he/she is not into reading. The book is short but full of wisdom. I only gave it 4 stars because the idea of the book (and even the title) are taken from "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" which I gave 5 stars. So I didnt think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading. I actually recommend both books, but The Prophet is much easier to read, while Thus Spoke Zarathustra is deeper and more intelligent.

My friend Renee gave this to me a few years back and asked me to read The Prophet.  I started reading it shortly afterward and honestly had to stop for a little while because I tried consuming too much (sorry, my normal is history, historical fiction, and either sci-fi or fantasy); after all, this is poetry and philosophy and should be consumed like a fine wine or excellent scotch, slowly savoring the flavor.  Having let things slip a little longer than intended I started reading it again, this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me.  This time things flowed somewhat better for me.  The individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone.  While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me why both can be so strong.Rating this one is extremely complex.  Some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have; others flow over you, whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later.  Because I wasn't touched by all, I call this a very strong 4 star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a 5 star book.  What I can say though is thank you Renee for exposing me to The Prophet.

This book was given to me as a gift before I journeyed overseas on a  spiritual quest to &quot;find myself.&quot; I never got a chance to read it  until one month after I was there and I had lost my job, my relationship  was very unsteady, and being so far form home, I felt completely isolated.  After skipping around the book and reading sections that immediately  pertained to me at that point, I cried, not out of sadness, but out of  enlightenment...Gibran wrote his experiences,and his thoughts on life, but  they are such detailed poetic accounts, it applies to everyone at some  time, his writings have layers, and therefore this book can be read many  times over, and each time a new understanding will come. &quot;Your pain is  the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding...&quot;

I originally read this early in college and didn't think it was anything special then.  I saw it recently in a used bookstore for two bucks, so I bought it.It took about an hour to read.There were about a dozen short passages I underlined.  Most of them weren't really revelations, but rather really good analogies I liked or uniquely descriptive ways of presenting commonly known truths.

Being an Atheist, it may seem strange to some people that this book holds any meaning for me, but I think that, despite the religious references, people from all walks of life will relate to the poetic prose of The Prophet.Kahlil Gibran has been greatly celebrated in several countries for the book's simple yet biting phrases. Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love.As oppposed to most books containing the word "Prophet" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading "just one more section." What makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author's statements, but also the beauty of his words, the flow of his language.I hate to be like everyone else (in more instances than just this), but it does change you. It states what any prophecy should, and allows the religious aspects of the beliefs to take the backseat to the love of life and aspirations.Buy, read, and live by The Prophet's words.

I can't think of a title fitting enough. What can you say about a book that you believe to be one-of-a-kind? I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to. I suppose I could at least explain why I find this book to be so unique.First of all this book covers most all of life's complex issues in the simplest fashion, and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation. Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself.  I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret  like I did,  I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the "Urantia Book" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. "The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained." ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity. I cannot think of anyone who would not love this book.

I've always been wary of stories claiming ownership of principles of truth and wisdom, and attempting to package them in tidy, marketable portions for mass consumption.  However, I found this novella unique and unpretentious in it's delivery of many truths that at first glance may appear intuitive, but in reality escape me in the daily practice of my life.  It was a well-written, thought-provoking tale that helped me focus on the most important things of my daily life.

My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading, rather than the timeless content, the quality of which is well known.I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer's reading. I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to. Unlike another reviewer, I was not at all distracted by the music; in fact, I barely noticed it. Taste in such things is a personal issue, and for what it's worth, this reading very much suits my tastes.

Gibran's words strike as deep and sudden as lightning, and lay bare to you, with unbelievable simplicity, the truths of human life. And they do so beautifully. To read this book is to enrich yourself, enlighten yourself, and to enjoy some of the most beautiful words ever written. Gibran's accompanying drawings are as mystical and moving as his words, and accentuate the utterances of the Prophet.The sheer wisdom and beauty of this little book is undeniable. All hail the Prophet.

Here is a book that will get your spiritual side working again.  This book subscribes to no particular religion(s), but gives much to reflect upon.  This is a short book.  It will only take you around an hour or so to read it.  But if you want to take a break from the hectic day-to-day lives we lead and think about the deeper meanings of life, this book is for you.  It's the story of a prophet that comes to a town and gives the townspeople his wisdom.  They ask him questions about life, and he gives them deep spiritual answers.  Simple concept, great read.

An unusual departure of an imaginary prophet ... Saying goodbye, his people gather around him asking about human nature and life!!The dialogue takes the form of questions and answers...which makes it a little monotonous...but the poetic language and the symbolic style of explanation takes your mind away and makes you wonder impatiently what the next question will be!!An inspiring revelation of truths ..."Love one another, but make not a bond of love...Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music"

This man was a son of a pastor, but worshipped a profit, not God - Do your homework on him. The Bible is the truth. Don't be misled by what this book tells you.This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing "Jesus, the Son of Man", he thought of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;. Years later, after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, at a viewing of a movie of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, Gibran rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an exalted station of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; and left the event weeping. A noted scholar on Gibran is Suheil Bushrui from Gibran's native Lebanon, also a Bah&aacute;'&iacute;, published more than one volume about him and serves as the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland and winner of the Juliet Hollister Awards from the Temple of Understanding.Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;' (Arabic: &#1593;&#1576;&#1583; &#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1607;&#1575;&#1569;&#8206;&#8206;; 23 May 1844 - 28 November 1921), born `Abb&aacute;s Effend&iacute;, was the eldest son of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h,[1] the founder of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith.

I recently read an article in The New Yorker Magazine about Kahlil Gibran, writer born in the middle east to Christian parents. Kahlil Gibran managed to immigrate to NYC with his mother and siblings.  Gibran's personal life and his early death, his exotic looks and ability to both write and paint is what attracted me to read his masterpiece "The Prophet".  It is a mystic story, written in verse, less than 100 ages long with a dozen fantastic paintings that remind of magical realism in painting.  The book is a manifest on how to live, love, work, dress, embrace joy and sorrow, accept righteousness and mankind far from perfection.  It is a book of duality that in the most beautiful language a young philosopher teaches the ways to live life.  No matter what world, culture, continent or country one comes from,this verse is universal.  If anything, this piece of work has compelled me to seek out other of Gibran's work.  I need to get into a mind of this wonderful thinker who himself led a very complicated and solitary life.  It has been a long time since I read anything as beautiful and touching as this piece of literature.

You've got to be kidding, all you 5 star reviewers!  This overly sentimental trash is sickening! It just rambles on and on with nonsense. It is said that Gibran is a great poet. Really? It has no poetic value whatsoever. Save your $2, my friend, and if you're looking for enlightenment try &#34;Siddhartha&#34;.

I am almost 51 years old. When i was 18 and deeply conflicted, weighted down with the confusions that can only be so impossibly painful at that young age, my mother gave me a hardback copy of "The Prophet". I've carried it with through all these years as a treasured companion. It helped me make sense of the non-sense my life was back there in 1974, and has comforted me more then a couple times in the years since then, as well.Today i'm here at Amazon to buy the same book for my 19-year-old daughter. She's a bright, warm, funny, sweet girl who is undergoing no small amount of angst as her comfy girlhood world slips away.  Her friends have begun to scatter to the winds--some to jobs and some to college--and her own adult responsibilities loom ever taller.Why, she has asked me, why do i feel so sad? I have no reason to be so sad--but i am. Why?And my mind has flashed to:"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.And how else can it be?"So i want this book for my wonderful daughter.  I think she's ready for it and, better, i think it will help the turmoil in her soul as it did for me when i was her age, and for my mother before me.

Inspirational and true teachings about various aspects of life are what you will find when you read this beautiful book. The book is short, 96 pages, and includes artwork by the author. The short chapters begin with various people (a ploughman, a judge, a woman, a rich man, an old priest, a mason, a hermit, etc.)asking the mystic to speak about different subjects of life, such as:  On Beauty, On Good and Evil, On Marriage, On Joy and sorrow, on friendship, and many more)I have to say that if I had come across this book much earlier in my life, I know I would not have understood or appreciated the beauty of it. I mentioned a quote from this book to a friend once who told me that her mother in law gave her the book years ago, and she had never read it. I told her what a treasure it was and after (finally) reading it, she loved it too.There is so much wisdom here to learn from. This is an incredible book!

I am alive like you, and I am standing beside you.Close your eyes and look around, you will see me in front of you.~Gibran's words on his EpitaphThe Prophet captures the teachings of Kahlil Gibran in a comforting story that succinctly touches on everyday topics like love, giving, joy, sorrow, freedom, pain, teaching, friendship and beauty. Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer "dwell in the solitude of your heart" so they "live in your lips."As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his "ship arrives" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home."Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?"The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: "Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory."Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as "her young prophet."  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart."But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night." ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review

The prevailing popularity of Gibran's PROPHET lies in only one secret: he writes his poems with readers in his mind. The compassionate poet I come to know through his lines, Gibran did not write to impress, shock or confuse but to communicate truth with highest poetic beauty. THE PROPHET addresses 27 essential subjects of life that concerns everyone - love, freedom, children, work, self-knowledge, friendship, time, beauty, death to name a few. I have this book for many years but this is a kind of poetry that ripens with time and each time you take a sip, it still surprises you with refreshing revelations. Also recommended are his less known books, A TEAR AND A SMILE, SAND AND FOAM and THE GARDEN OF THE PROPHET.

This is a very usefull book that can be used as a secondary source for your primary religious texts. Not only does it give you excellent prophetic sayings, but when reading anyone could have a diffrent interpretation. Here is some things you could look to find:-Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.-Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."-Say not, "I have found the path of the soul," but rather, " I have met the soul walking upon my path."  For the soul walks upon all paths.-You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts.-For what is evil, but good tortured by it's own hunger and thurst.-And beauty is not a need, but an ecstasy.-Who can seperate his faith from his actions, or his belief from his occupation.-To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconsistency.-No man can reveal to you aught but that wich is already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.-If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshhold of your own mind.-And even as each of you stands alone in god's knowledge, so must each of you be alone in his knowledge of God and his understanding of the earth.

I recently reread this after many years and found the words to resonate with wisdom and spiritual centeredness. The book can be enjoyed and read with profit by people from all faiths and traditions. Each will find some treasure that speaks to their heart. There is nothing in THE PROPHET that would contradict or conflict with any of the sacred texts of the world's major religions. It somehow encompasses the teachings of all of them in a secular and beautiful work of literature.

This book was a philosophical touchstone for insecure Boomers of the mid-1970s. Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:"...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited..."In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how "relevant" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song "Consider Me Gone" for consideration:"To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell"

One of the best books written in English, ever.  Simple, yet extremely penetrating like &#34;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&#34;, deeply thought-provoking like &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land&#34;, semantically precise yet as moving as the Psalms of David, Gibran's masterpiece is timeless.

This is a wonderful expression of some of the fundamental truths of human nature and existence. This little book is always on my desk and every now and I revisit it again and ruminate over the wisdom that Al Mustafa gives to the people of the city of Orphalese.As Al Mustafa prepares to leave Orphalese after 12 years, the seeress Almitra implores,"Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.And we shall give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish.In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and laughter of our sleep.Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death."...and thus begins the beautiful explanation of love, marriage, children, houses, clothes, teaching, talking, religion and many more. Actually you can read this entire book online, so you don't necessarily need to purchase one to enjoy it. Some of my favorite ones include, On Houses, On Teaching, On Talking and On religion.and he parts by saying ,"Less hasty am I than the Wind, yet I must go.We wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us"

As he (the "prophet") awaits the ship that will return him to his home country after fourteen years of being absent, he begins providing answers in colorful parables to questions raised by the occupants of the city he has temporarily made his home.  We follow this spiritual man as the loving townspeople seek him out for wisdom.  There is ultimately great sadness when he departs.I would describe these writings as poetic, philosophic prose for daily spiritual living.  There are many sound words, with a relaxed style, and a somewhat universalistic belief.  It is okay.Lord's blessingsScott

I can never quite make up my mind on this book. I read it years ago and was also somewhat puzzled by it. Rereading it I feel vague inspiring feeling, and the other a kind of vague repulsion. I see many many readers are inspired by the work. I myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of Whitman and Zarathustra, but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter.I believe the most famous section of the work of twenty- six poetic essays is the one on 'Love"Here is some of this:"Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;For love is sufficient unto love.When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather, I am in the heart of God."And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.I am reminded when I read this of Bellow's description of the healer in 'Seize the Day' Dr. Temkin. On the one hand he says and thinks that it is phony  , and on the other he hears certain things and says ' True , True.'.I must admit my reaction remains mixed. I do not feel it is really poetic truth of the highest value, but I do not feel it is without value either.

Should we, could we all walk through life in such an enlightened state? What a wonderful peaceful world it would be. How can we deny that Kahlil Gibran was directed by the Gods to deliver a message: "be as one, live in the light, love is the only answer!" and so I paraphrase, but in truth, it is a way of life that is essential to the well-being of mankind.

If I have ever read a book that is timeless, other than the Word of God, it would have to be this one.  Although I may not have agreed with every word written, so many of the words of wisdom within these pages brought peace and comfort to me.I read this book many, many years ago.  I quoted from it at times and thought of it often. The words seemed to wrap themselves around your heart and spring out in times of need. There are not many books that can stake that claim, and I have read many.A classic in my opinion and a book that will never be outdated.Recommended.

Have you ever read a line, first you feel the language is beautiful and next a thought, even a reality hits you? And even after you have finished, the message keeps playing on and on in your mind? Well, this book is one of them (if you have luckily found other books by other author).It is the exploration of self, soul, community, nature, and universe. No matter what religion you hold, from where you came or who/what you are. This is a book for every human being to know and keep in perspective what they are doing everyday.

Like watching an Olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading Khalil Gibran is in many ways indescribeable.In that way, it's good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving anectodes of how it personally touched them.  But ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who've gone to some great vacation spot.Sure, they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there.Because of the way this book is written, some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word.I wish we could award more than five stars.  I wish it could be an infinity...for every heart touched by this wonderful, wonderful book.

I turn to The Prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track. This book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living, and does so in a creative, thought-provoking way. I first learned of Kahlil Gibran and The Prophet during a sermon at a Unitarian Universalist church, and I ran to get the book. It's occupied an important place on my bookshelf ever since. It helps me realize that life is a process, and letting go is a big part of moving forward. It also reminds me to be mindful of how I think about and interact with the world. It keeps things in perspective. The Prophet is an inspirational read.

At least 6 out of 5 stars! "The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain", is my favourite quote from this classic book of magical mystical poetry and philosophy. There is insight and wisdom on every page. 25 years after someone first leant me a copy, it seems to have more relevance to life's fundamental challenges than ever.Kahlil Gibran tells the story of Almastafa's departure from the city of Orphalese. As he leaves, the prophet (Almastafa) shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience. "Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding", "Work is love made visible", "And think not that you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course".However "The Prophet" is much more than a few inspiring self-help quotes. More a case of some of the deepest Eastern wisdom, universally applicable to the human condition. Long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world.

It is a true masterpiece in which almost every, if not every word counts.  I have read it over and over again, since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before I left for Berkeley to attend law school.  I have given copies to many friends, and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully.There is enormous wisdom in each chapter, especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings.  Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life, and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century.This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about.  Indeed, it can be picked up at any age, and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written.I urge anyone, who is thinking about buying it, to do so.  Just peruse a copy at a local bookstore or library, and you are apt to become enthralled.  It may take several readings to soak up its essence; and even after many years, I still find nuances and learn more each time I reread it.

"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'"--Kahlil GibranAs you read, Gibran's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you.  Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again.Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's "Search This Book" facility unfortunately do not do "The Prophet" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later.  Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, "Speak to us of Children."And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.

A very short book, only 133 pages published in 1926. To be honest I have no idea why I downloaded this. I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that!  Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, 'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.'The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you.  On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of 'The Prophet' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his 'home'.MarriageChildrenGivingEating and DrinkingWorkJoy and SorrowCrime and PunishmentFreedomReason and PassionPainTeachingFriendshipGood and EvilPrayerPleasureReligionDeathSo many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!I'm not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible.  I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen.  But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133

Beautiful, wholly accessible, brought tears to my eyes.  As graceful as Jesus' parables must have been when freshly spoken, without the distortion of time and culture and multiple translations.  The Prophet had been on my list of "oh yeah, I've heard about it and probably should read it one day" books.  A friend's recommendation bumped it from there into my Kindle.  This is the book that motivated me to learn how to underline and save notes, the Kindle equivilent of dog-earing my favorite parts.  (Somehow less satisfying than a dog-ear, but really easy to retrieve later.)Other books that have made it from the list to my shopping cart sit largely unread because they are just too much work.  I probably won't read Don Quixote, for example, until I'm sitting on the Spanish Med and polishing my classic Spanish.  Easy AND good for you.  How perfect is that?

Gibran may be a poet, rather than a true prophet - but the simple truths in this book seem applicable to all religions. The short passages on love, children, pain, beauty, death and other timeless topics are full of insight and inspiration, but completely lacking in the politics and self-righteousness that pervade so many religions. This book is goodness, plain and simple, and it changed my life more than any other book I can recall reading.

I plan to buy this book,and a few others,that I had a long time ago. To write a better review I would need to refresh myself on Eastern or Middle Eastern mysticism;Persian more specifically,Sufism and also the background of Kahlil Gibran.What I can say is that these small stories or parables or fables are Zen-like; thought-provoking and instructive. I loved this book when I read it and I wrote one of my (still) best poems while I was in the state of mind this book put me in. (I'm positive it was just after I turned 16 because I have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a Friday night football game in the distance from the high school...and not wanting to go to another football game because I had to free my friend from the outside port-a-potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out....and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out. She did the same thing I would do.Anyone of any age can enjoy this book,I just wish I had a copy around so I could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review. Of course I'm sure I would have read it more than the one time I read it, if I did have the same copy I had when I was a teenager. I always read books I really like more than one time.This book and The Little Prince by Saint Exupery;Siddhartha,Demian and Steppenwolf (all by Herman Hesse) are books I read at the same time period and that I also don't have anymore,either because I gave my copy to someone;or,had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away, or,they just went the way of all things,as things go...in time (and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago...sigh.... 16 has also "gone the way of all things"....but not completely!)Anyone who likes The Prophet (or any of the other titles I mentioned) can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read,or who has one of these books on their bookshelves;or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature. (It's  "A Beatles Thing". Not so much connected to The Beatles, but people who like the same type of music always like their friends more,when their friends like the same type of music that they like. Beatles, Zeppelin,Pink Floyd,Rob Zombie, Black Sabbath or Godsmack...Or Johann Sebastian Bach...writing or music,it's still art. And we just feel more comfortable with people who have interests or feelings or an intellect similar to our own. ....Aesthetic magnetism is a vibration more in tune with the spirit;and everyone is in love with their soul-mate(s)...to have common ground; or be in sympathy with one another on a deeper level than the common plane of the inescapable movements of the mundane.)....Anyone reading The Prophet,and finding themselves on common ground with the author,will find gratification,and will know exactly what I mean in what I wrote in this short review.

The Prophet Almustafa waits in the city of Orphalese for his ship to take him home.  For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.  The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times.  The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.Victoria Tarrani

Gibran's Prophet is the best example of how simple prose can be used to convey deep and powerful statement. As the name suggests, the book just recounts some sermons given by a prophet. The themes discussed include love, family, friendship, freedom, etc. This is one of those classsics that one must own and read every once in a while, for the wisdom in these words is bound to make every reader a better, completer person. It is a spiritual prose, full of deep insight and inspiration for one and all.Some qoutes that I particularly like:And ever it has been that love knows not his own depth until the hour of separation.When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep.Work is love made visible.Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy can it contain.Your house is your larger body.And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than thier misdeeds.For reason, ruling alone is a force confining;And passion, unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction.Your pain is breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.For self is a sea, boundless and measureless.For vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.In longing for your giant self lies your goodness and that longing is in all of you.Trust your dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.

"The Prophet" is Almustafa, called "the chosen and the beloved," who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as "Prophet of God" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which "the Prophet" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of "inspirational fiction" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, "the Prophet" says, "Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'"  Jesus said, "You shall know THE truth" (John 8:32), and, "I am the way, THE truth, and the life" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a "spiritual masterpiece," so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, "Ugh."  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, "It's all Greek to me," but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were "all Greek" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet "brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes."  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what "the Prophet" says about clothes.  "Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment."  Oh, by the way, even as simply "poetry" it just doesn't do anything for me.  It is not a book that I would recommend to anyone under any circumstances.

Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of prosaic poetry.  Despite being a native-born Arabic speaker, Gibran wrote The Prophet in English, ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation.The work's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey.  The words that flow from the prophet's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life.  Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as "On Friendship", "On Pain" and "On Death."  What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest.  The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity.The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating.  Amazingly, Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages, making it a very quick and easy read.  Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran's words.The Prophet, which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece, is a timeless literary classic.  Its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so.

I know Beryl Bainbrige is a great writer but...this was my first Bainbridge novel and I didn't enjoy it very much. Am I not getting it? I have so many questions unanswered by this book. Why were Dr. Potter and Myrtle suffering through the Crimean war when they didn't have to be there? Was it Myrtle's utter devotion that kept her there? Why was Potter there? Were they camp followers? Also, did Myrtle bear Georgie and his wife's children for them because the wife couldn't? Or am I dreaming? There seems so much allusion in this book and I feel dumb for not getting what the other reviewers are getting from it. For me, it wasn't clear or easy to follow and I am not a stupid person. I'm a bit disappointed but will try another book of hers and hope that I will enjoy it more..

A reading of this book resembles a leafing through an album of old photographs dedicated to some unknown man named George Hardy. Each of the three narrators, who were once connected and loved him (though in different  manner and degree), shows two pictures and tells their prehistories. The  image of Master Georgie as a respectable, decent man turns into a central  figure of such a weird sexual and family conundrum that it will take some  time to perceive; an affectionate son turns into a frigid father and lover;  a drunkard into a brave surgeon of the English army during the Crimean War;  etc. The book ends in horrible bloody scenes of the senseless war carnage.  Ms Beryl Bainbridge does not give an opportunity for George Hardy to speak,  so we close the book but still do not understand who and what was George  and why these three persons were so devoted to him. Just as in a real life:  people come and go, we think we know them, but we usually know only their  external appearance, and their essence remains a mystery...

It's difficult to know quite where to begin here, in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers. It's not that it's badly written, just that it fails to illuminate Master Georgie's life. That after all should be its purpose, particularly where, as here, that person existed and at least one of the events described took place. The author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms, which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure, but instead we see him through a glass darkly. I may be in a minority of one, but it failed to live up to my expectations.

Master Georgie is a novel set in the time of the Crimean War. Through the eyes of three people close to Master Georgie, Myrtle, a girl believed to be Georgie's sister, Dr. Potter, a geologist and Pompey Jones, the photography assistant, we follow him from Liverpool to the battlefield of the Crimean War.This way to write about a person and his happenings is well known through Ian Pears An Instance of the Fingerpost. And can be a perfect way to keep the readers interest and also the readers capability to live with the story. But Beryl Bainbridge do not master this art in this book. The language is too flat, without feelings, and the plots are sometimes too cryptical to be understood. I had to read several parts more than once to be able to understand what it all really was about, and to understand which lenses where used.Still the book has some good parts, among them are the battlefield scenes. And I also like the way Bainbridge use the meaning of the photography, to let us see snapshots of Master Georgie's life, using other people as lenses, as cameras.The book is a short one, less than 200 pages, and the surprising ending helps to give meaning to the story.Britt Arnhild Lindland

Historic fiction requires exceptional skills to capture character as well as time and place. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie certainly excels in this regard, reminding me of the skills of Hilary Mantel. The plight of a Crimean War surgeon comes alive in all its gore and misery and insanity. The tale is told through the eyes of the surgeon's brother-in-law, his off and on boyfriend and photographic assistant, and Myrtle, an orphan informally adopted by the family and mother of his children. The Crimean War offers a backdrop of incompetent diplomatic and military leadership dissolving into a nightmare of gore, horror, disease, dysentery, crime, and cruelty. Bainbridge captures the disorganized international disaster with many horrible bloody details, having her characters do the best they can to survive the catastrophe. Yet, Bainbridge captures more than just history, time, place, and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb. Early in the novel, Myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush, they float like dandelion seed up the wind-draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier. It is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time. The pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters. I almost think she wrote too little in this book. I would have loved to have the book twice as long. The character of Pompey Jones, the bisexual street urchin, is fascinating and I wish Bainbridge had written a novel just for this self-aware, self-assured, character to follow Master Georgie. Bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of Myrtle, and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover George Hardy. Myrtle and Pompey are both orphans, street wise, highly intelligent, and are recognized for their strengths by the Hardy family.George Hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden. As a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home, it appears that his service in the Crimean is somewhat of a penance, a sacrifice, for his sexuality. He strives to be the perfect son to his father, mother, and siblings, yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family. George Hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the Crimean War due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control. In some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the Victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation. George is contrasted with Pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality, recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women. The narrative of war is haunting, reminding me of the outstanding novels of Pat Barker about World War I. We read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body. It is the third narrator, Dr. Potter, George's brother-in-law that offers unique looks at all the other characters. Potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time. He lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident. Overall the book is excellent, a post-modern masterpiece, telling a complex tale from multiple points of view but never giving the `definitive' story behind the story.

I'd heard so much about Bainbridge...how she has been nominated (and overlooked) for the Booker five times...how her short novels are beloved by a cultish following. So I grabbed Master Georgie while on a business trip  and buried myself in its atmosphere. I don't think I've read anyone like  her. One of the reviewers here compared the experience to browsing through  a collection of photos, and that is true. Somewhat frustrating, though, is  that - as with aged photographs - you never quite get the feeling that you  know these characters or have their full stories. Maybe if Beryl Bainbridge  were sitting alongside me to fill in the gaps. Nevertheless, I'm ready to  plunge into another Bainbridge and am curious to know if anyone else has  favorites.

The news of the death of Beryl Bainbridge last year made me want to read books by a very accomplished writer. In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge

I finished this book as fast as I could. I felt the author was on another wavelength to the reader. I didn't care that the story was about this Georgie fellow. He seemed peripheral and the written perspective on him  oblique. The writing was good and I may try some other of the authors works  but the plot was feeble. Try Pat McCabe's breakfast on Pluto for energy and  a raw story or Ian McEwan's Amsterdam for a page turner with a plot of some  interest. Thumbs down for this one.

In a revolving first person narrative, three people who are close to George narrate the events of their mid-nineteenth century life. These narrations center around photographs taken at certain points. Through the course of the novel the idea of an image taken is made increasingly more complex as is the mystery of George who is most often portrayed idealistically as a man of high knowledge and wisdom. Through the carefully written language of the narrative, there are surprisingly human incidents and facts revealed that are startlingly human. These are placed in the frame of the historical context leading to the war between England and Russia. The gruesome events of the war that follow strip each of the three characters of their pretence and leaves them yearning for the image of their lost ideal, Master George. This is a fascinating experiment in looking at ways of perception, the identities they fashion for people and the personal impact of assumptions about other people's identities.

Geroge Hardy, a surgeon and amateur photographer, discovers his father dead in the bed of another woman and hastens to bring the body home before his mother learns of it.  Three people help with this task, and their lives are irrevocaly changed because of it.The story is told through the eyes of those three people close to Master Georige.  The first is Myrtle, a young orphan who is accepted and raised by the Hardy family.  She immediately falls in love with Georgie, a love that will carry her from the streets of Liverpool to the battlefields of the Crimean War.  Next is Pompey Jones, a young street boy who helps move the body of George's father and then discovers George's passion for young men.  The last is Dr. Potter, a family friend who follows George all the way to the Battle of Inkermann, never understanding George's aversion to women or why he wants to attach himself to a unit during the awful war.  Through their eyes, we watch George change from a young doctor in England dealing with his father's troublesome death to the hardened field doctor trying to save lives during a time of war.This is a fantastic historical novel, with some of the most descriptive war scenes I've read in quite some time.  Bainbridge makes you feel the confusion, fear and dread that the soldiers faced both due to battle and due to disease.  At the same time, she shows how one life can effect others, either for better or for worse.  A highly engrossing novel.

I was attracted to this mesmerizing novel by its meditations on 19th century photography, Victorian middle-class hypocrisy and the Crimean War. Photography binds this brief novel together and Bainbridge revels in its  historical and metaphorical possibilities. She organizes her chapters  around photographs, which makes the reader immediately aware that she/he is  to infer meaning from this practice and speculate on the role of  photography in determing what and how we see and remember. Bainbridge is  very sensitive to and aware of 19th century photography: its use during the  Crimean War (the first war that photographs were taken of), connection to  both science and magic, and the practice of post-mortem photography. The  reader does have to work to explore the themes suggested by the author, but  her historical grounding, lucid prose and rich subject make the effort  worthwhile.

Bainbridge is simply a genius.Master Georgie is a classic.An entralling read,full of off beat characters whose hope and dreams are tragically mistimed.Their miserable lives entwined poetically reaching a climax in a  wasteful war. A brilliantly gripping ripping yarn of a story subtly and  savagely told by a master.

A masterful evocation of a time and a war that took place 150 years ago and life's little ironies that brought these characters together in the first place to determine their fate.

At first, I was going to tick Beryl Bainbridge off for writing too well, too literary.  I thought it nonsense that an illiterate girl in nineteenth century Liverpool could never write such exquisite prose as evidenced in  this novel, and that this was a case of the authorial voice being too  strong.  As it happened, I couldn't have been more wrong.  This novel is  narrated by the close acquaintances of 'Master Georgie' (although some are  closer than others), starting with the illiterate Myrtle.  Immediately we  are drawn into the action, as this sequence of a photograph being taken  will resound throughout the novel.  'Master Georgie' is incredibly subtle,  and it is only by looking back over it that you begin to appreciate that  this is the most suitable of beginnings.  Here is where Myrtle begins on  her road to becoming a lady.  And what an unsavory road it is, as Myrtle's  help is initially required to cover up the manner in which George Hardy's  father has died, and leads to the bloody battlefields of the Crimea.  Also  assisting with the cover-up is the duck-boy and street urchin, Pompey Jones  and the pompous Dr. Potter, whose narrations are by far the best.  George  Hardy himself is an ambiguous figure, seen only through the eyes of others.  It may be a fault that we never really get to know him.  This is a novel  of cameras, carnality, and carnage.  The dreadful shadow of history is cast  upon it, with the famous charge of the Light Brigade lightly alluded to.  One almost expects to run into a lady with a lamp at every corner, but  fortunately, Bainbridge avoids this excess.  She takes events frozen in  time, such as the front cover's photograph, and brings them into life and  death, and maybe even beyond.  The camera never lies... Or does it?  Bainbridge fervently burrows into the psyche of characters, enabling them  to bring about apparitions vivid enough to be captured by film.  In my  mind's eye, I see Bainbridge pouring over ancient photographs from the  Crimea, trying to put names to faces and to see if she could walk around in  their bloody shoes.  She succeeds.  If I'd have been on 1998's Booker  panel, I know I would have placed Bainbridge before McEwan.  And the reason  wouldn't have the desire to give her a consolatory, but demeaning, long  service award.  In this instance, 'Master Georgie' speaks for itself.

At first glance Master Georgie by Beryl Bainbridge suggests it might be quite a light book, an easy read, a period piece set in the mid-nineteenth century. This would be wrong. Master Georgie is no safe tale of country house manners, of marriages imagined by confined, embroidering young women. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility.Master Georgie is a surgeon and photographer, and the book is cast in six plates - photographic plates, not chapters. Death figures throughout. From start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book's characters. We begin with Mr Moody, dead in a brothel bed, his host of minutes before in shock. Later we move to the Crimean War, where the carnage is graphic, extensive and apparently random. And even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering.The book uses multiple points of view. We see things Master Georgie's way. Myrtle, an orphan he takes in, adds her perspective. The fussy geologist, Dr Potter, imprints his own version of reality. And still there are less than explained undercurrents, undeclared motives which affect them all. Thus, overall, Master Georgie is a complex and ambitious novel. Though it is set in a major war, the backdrop is never allowed to dominate. The characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions, but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting.But we also never really get to know these people. Myrtle, perhaps, has the strongest presence. She has a slightly jaundiced, certainly pragmatic approach to life. But even she finds the privations of wartime tough. Why the characters of Master Georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself. And ultimately this was my criticism of Beryl Bainbridge's book. While the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking, I found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives. The beauty of the prose, however, more than made up for any shortcoming. The language created the mixed world of mid-nineteenth century politeness and juxtaposed this with the visceral vulgarities of soldiering and the general struggle of life. This rendered Master Georgie a complex, moving and quite beautiful book.

It is amazing how some writers can blather on for hundreds of pages and yet be barren of memorable phrase or image, yet how a select few demonstrate the maxim of &quot;less is more.&quot;  Beryl Bainbridge and  her most recent novel Master Georgie surely fall into this latter category.  Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents.  This is an effective technique, as the  photographic image provides both a jumping-off point for Bainbridge's  particular scene and narrator (the novel is given from several points of  view) and a framing device for the scene. I look forward to more of her  fiction.

The back cover of this book praises Beryl Bainbridge for her &quot;deadpan prose&quot; and her &quot;emotionless sentences&quot;. It's ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George's father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George's sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It's like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It's the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got. I skipped over some pages to get to the end. I didn't care about the character's fates. I just wanted to say i finished it.

Ms. Beryl Bainbridge writes Historical Fiction with as much skill as any writer, and much better than others who attempt the genre. Her stories rarely have definitive separations between what actually happened, and what might have happened to the characters she creates. The Crimean War is the setting this time, and while historically noteworthy is not as familiar as some of her other subjects, like The Titanic, or the doomed Scott Expedition to the South Pole. What is consistent is her ability to jump about through time periods without ever losing credibility. Each of her books reads as if a unique pen is behind each one. The hand of course is the same, however the moods created are remarkably singular.The character that is the book's title is a complex human study, or if you prefer, a very intricate person but occupied with a mind and personality as muddled, as it is diverse. A grotesque death scene is the entrance for one of the narrator's of the book, an individual that would have lived as a street urchin but for chance, and an ambiguous bit of goodwill. A second street personality with many more wiles and flexible conduct also becomes a member of Master Georgie's entourage. This second narrator has a unique view of events, as he is close when Master Georgie requires, for the latter's sexuality is repressed at best. These are just two people who eventually head to the middle of The Crimean War, and the question that keeps shadowing the reader is why?Escape from the latter half of 19th century London is an easy answer for George, but what of the others? Taking a trip toward an impending war as George's groupies is one matter, staying in the midst of a war is much more puzzling. This is one of the most difficult of Ms. Bainbridge's books that I have read. Previous works have often served as a metaphor for the time they occupy, or the closing act in a World that is about to undergo great disruptive change. This work is not as apparently decisive.One characteristic is consistent, and that is her master's grasp of language. A lapful of cherries that serve as a metaphor will haunt a reader for some time. Her images of the dead and dying are less grotesquely graphic than most writers portray, but are far more disturbing than other wartime battles. This may not be the best of her work if it is the first of hers you experience, however if you can successfully decipher this one, that are several others that are much more comfortable to read.

This book is well written and very organized. The author did an excellent job of explaining a complicated subject and I was surprised at how easy it was to read. It was so interesting and informative that couldn't put the book down once I started to read it. I purchased four more books of different titles and read them with the same ease. It's not that the subject is any easy read but it was so clearly explained and flowed very nicely as it untangled many questions that I had concerning prophecy. I purchased this title for a friend of mine and highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Bible prophecy.

Without a doubt, IMHO, this book has got to be one of the best ever done on the last book of the Bible and how those thing written there relate to other prophetic books of the Bible (Especially the book of Daniel) and history. It is beautifully written and has many detailed charts and pictures. What is really cool is to realize this book was done in the early 1900's, before The Jewish people went back home and reclaimed the land God promised them. I loved this book and it confirmed the truth found within the Bible. RMS

How people can make these types of mistakes is beyond me. There appears to have been no editor or proofreading before putting this up for sale and apparently no quailty control measures on Amazon's part. The problems:1. 4,500 locations or 450 pages are missing. This ebook is 500 locations or 50 pages.2. The reviews posted on the &#34;Kindle Store&#34; were clearly for the hard copy version3.  This &#34;book&#34; give a page or two &#34;outline&#34; of a topic. Example- there is no information detailing the seven churches like in the hard copy version just a 2 page turn &#34;outline&#34; saying the Book of Revelations speaks about seven churches.4. Complete information is just missing. The table of content looks consistent with the hard copy version yet once you spend $3.99 to buy it and click on a TOC link subtiles are not there.5. This ebook is just a very brief overview of what is in the Book of Revelations and what is in Larkin's actual book.I will be getting a refund from Amazon.

This book is an excellent book to read in addition to the Bible.  If you have some knowledge of the Bible you will find this book offers some additional insight that is not in other commentaries. This author is an inspiration to me to dig deeper in the word of God.  Because it is written in 1929 do not let that cause you to think it is old school and outdated.  It is not!  I am still reading it as it is too much information to ingest in a couple days.  The book starts off with an explanation that the Bible was written "for all classes of people and for our learning" and the Bible is not addressed to all people in general. Part of the Bible is to addressed to the Jews, Gentiles and to the Church which consititute the three classes. Mr. Larkin gives his explanation of the ages and dispensations. He continues on to explain the age of the earth that in Gen 1:3-31 was the restoration of the earth to its original condition before it was made "formless and void" and submerged in water and darkness and how there is millenniums of time that science may require for the formation of the earth as a planet. His teachings throughout the book are thought-provoking and shed some light on questions I have had such as election and free-will, Heaven and Hell, Judiaism and Christianity. It is 328 pages of Biblical explanations and charts. I definitely find this a must read.

ISBN 0394826922 - I'd already read and reviewedI'll Teach My Dog a Lot of Words (Bright & Early Board Books(TM))when this, the unabridged version, fell into my lap. While I think the shorter, abridged version is a great introduction, this is what you want those little readers building up to!A young, faceless, pet owner plans to teach his dog 100 words, impressing the entire town - including the mayor. Simple words like "walk" and "beg" are only the beginning of the plan. He also intends to teach him "stand on Uncle Abner's thumb" and "paint the road from here to there"... Plans, however, are one thing; getting started is quite another.Author Michael Firth is fantastic, as usual, with simple language made extraordinarily fun. P. D. Eastman's illustrations are perfect - they're fun and funny and complement the text. Kids will laugh and learn and that, to be honest, is who we're really interested in teaching!- AnnaLovesBooks

I loved this book as a child and now I love it for my own daughter.I have vivid memories of a time when I could just newly read and barely count ...staying up well past my bedtime, writing down all the words that were new to the dog (i.e. not counting "a" more than once) and trying to count them to see if the book really had 100 words (it did!).  It was that engaging.  I remember it took me hours, and then when my mom caught me still awake, I lied and told her I had just woken up.The point in that is that as a small child, I found this book so intriguing that I was reading, writing, and counting for fun, well past my bedtime.  As an adult, I love the wit.  As a parent, I love that I get to share the childlike love for it all over again.This is such a fun book with real learning potential too.  Love it.

My family discovered this book when my younger brother was the age for picture books, and we all loved it.  In fact, we can still quote it by heart.The book is really just a list of things that start with the letter B, but the Berenstains have managed to create a story that's a lot of fun with it.  We follow the results when a bear, a bull, and a baboon blow bubbles and bike backwards.  What happens?  Well, they bump into all kinds of things.  And the more they bump, the more absurd the book gets and the more fun it truly is.As I said, we all loved this book.  It was clever and charming and so out there you can't help but laugh at it.  Each page pretty much repeats what came before while adding a new layer to the chaos.  And the illustrations capture what is happening perfectly.This is a true classic picture book.  If you can find a copy, you're family will love it.

We bought this after our daughter loved the 'A' book so much. It was a great title for a learning reader and it's simple vocabulary and engaging illustrations made us regret that the series stopped with 'the C book'.

I read this book to my children 35 & 38 years ago and they loved it.  My new 14 month old grandson loves it as well bringing it to read to him many times a day.  Alliterative and repetitive, when read with expression, it is great fun for us all.  I think it is out of print so I was delighted to find this.

During the night, my little boy tipped over his toy bin and used it to scale his bookshelves. This morning there were a pile of about twenty books on the floor and he wanted me to read every one of them. For the most part, he would lose interest after a page or two, but a few he listened to right until the end. Those books deserve a write-up.That he listened all the way through The Berenstains' B Book surprised me. I did lose interest after about the fourth page, but he was loving all those Bs, so I read it to the end. This is a silly little book, which, not shockingly emphasizes the letter B. It becomes quite a tricky tongue-twister long before you reach the end of the book. I couldn't really tell you what specifically my three-year-old liked about the book, but he did really enjoy it.The illustrations feature the funnel-snouted animals of the Berenstains -- cute and colorful, but not easily recognizable, and, therefore not my favorite style. Again, my little boy liked all the silly images and colors, even if he didn't believe me that the bear was supposed to be a bear.

The text consists of words beginning with B with a minimum of any other words.  This is a great idea for teaching beginning readers, and I wish there were more books like this.The illustrations are cute and the the story is funny.  In other words, it's by the Berenstains.If you like the Berenstains, and if you like picture books with alliterative text, then you have two good reasons to try C is for Clown, 0001714422.

I remember this beloved book from when I was a child and first learning to read. I loved it then, as I do now. I recently bought a replacement copy FOR MYSELF, as my children misplaced it somewhere along the way. My lady asked me for whom I was purchasing the book and I responded truthfully, "Me." Gotta love the Berenstain Bears! I do, and I'm 47! I find myself often reciting the book whenever I'm feeling the need for a little lift of my mood and a spontaneous smile. Indulge yourself and any little ones in your life. You won't regret owning this classic.

Awkward cadence, lacks the usual old school Berenstain Bear charm (I despise the newer preachy books but expected this one to be up there with the great The Bear's Picnic.) The illustrations might be worth half a star but it's truly so dreadful I can't bring myself to go over a single star.

&quot;The Berenstain Bears on the Moon,&quot; by Stan and Jan Berenstain, is one of the best in the authors' excellent series of children's books. In this installment, Brother and Sister Bear, accompanied by their excitable pet dog, take a rocket trip to the moon and back.Although the book's primary purpose is entertainment and literacy education, the Berenstains do get some of the science right. The portray the gravity-free environment of the space ship's interior during the voyage, and they also show that the gravity on the lunar surface is much less than that on Earth.The book is illustrated in the typically appealing Berenstain Bears style. Particularly fun is the orange, green, and purple-colored rocket ship used by the intrepid space travelers. And the rhymes are equally fun. Example: &quot;Two little bears / and one little pup. / They are off to the moon, / going up, up, up!&quot; This irresistible adventure tale is definitely a high point in a beloved book series.

I love the Berenstain Bears, but this book stinks.  This is the only book of theirs that I rank low.  I grew up with the Berenstein Bear's books and love their illustrations and messages, but this one lacks in content and craftsmanship.  Buy every other Berenstein Bear book out there but skip this one.

Although Amazon advertises this book for ages 4-8, my wife and I started reading this and other Stan and Jan Berenstain books to our children from 18 months and up. Always a delight, our kids would laugh at the silliness while learning a lesson about life. We started a great habit of reading two or three books before bed, and the kids loved them. Soon, they would memorize many of the phrases, beginning a lifelong passion for reading.Every kid should experience reading books by the Berenstains while growing up. The characters are well developed, the rhyming phrases help kids become enthusiastic about reading, and the messages about life make them think.  Bears On The Moon got my son and daughter asking questions about space and interested in the great beyond.  Combine this with other fun Berenstain Bear books and your kids will sit enthralled as you turn the pages. Highly recommended.

Another one of the Berenstain Bears Early Readers.It's a lot of fun to read, and the rhymes work well. Very bouncy. I do have to suspend the disbelief of even the kidlets a little - they know full well that two children and a dog cannot go to the moon alone! - but that's all right.

A beautiful book. So wonderfully written that savoring the words was a joy, never mind the sensitive yet powerful story. Though the topics -- deafness, World War One -- suggest a very grim work, it ends up being a powerful affirmation of life.This book deserves to be much more widely known than it is; it's an excellent example of how even good books deserve ample promotion, as I think that it's a lot better than some major recent best-sellers. I was pleased to see in a bookstore recently that it's won an award.

This is a wonderful first novel about sound, silence, deafness, communication and love. Grania is a young girl who loses her hearing at the age of five. Her guilt-ridden mother refuses to accept that she is deaf and resists adapting to reality; only Grania's loving grandmother saves her from a life of illiteracy and loneliness. Grania is taught to read with &quot;The Sunday Book,&quot; a precious gift from her grandmother that becomes a metaphor for life's struggles and complications as Grania emerges from childhood, attends school, and meets &quot;Chim,&quot; a hearing man who loves her stillness. Just married, Grania must return home to wait while Jim goes to war as a stretcher bearer.Once again, WWI emerges as incredibly pointless and bloody, as men are thrown into the confusion of the European front. Jim experiences the war as a haze of brutal sound. He steels himself to the sight of mutilated men blown apart, but cannot stand the sight of their hands, which of course for him had become the instruments of his personal &quot;language of love&quot; with Grania. Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania's childhood who became her sister's husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine. Drawing on the foundation of love from her grandmother, the deaf Grania not only coaches him back to speech but heals her sister as well. The end of the novel feels tantalizingly like only the beginning for these wonderful multi-dimensional characters.Itani is a wonderful writer, and manages to convey to those of us who hear what it's like not to be able to--she also shows what we the hearing might be missing! The background on the theories of language and teaching the deaf was fascinating, and Itani must have done some meticulous research. This is a wonderful novel well worth your time.

The first part of this novel was a superb 99 pages.  My enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact I grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three.  Here is why:Part one is about a child named Grania growing up in Canada in the late 1800's.  A bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf.  Thankfully, Grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read.  I know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is.  Grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words.  Readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times.  When she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts.  The teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure Grania understands what is going on.  The children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her.  Most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb.  When Grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world.  It is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.Part two is about an adult Grania who falls in love with a hearing man named Jim.  Jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest.  I found his conversations with Grania dull and their romance a bit sappy.  My mind began to wander.Part three follows Jim as he enters World War One and the fighting he experiences or sees.  This created a problem for me, as I said earlier, Jim just didn't hold my interest.Part one seemed a novel all of its own.  The style changed after that.  I realize the story is about Grania and Jim and World War One, but it just was not written the same as part one.  I encourage people searching for deaf fiction and literature to pick this one up tho.

Set in the early decades of the 20th century through World War I in Onatrio, Canada and France, Deafening is two stories - the coming of age of young Grania struck totally deaf by scarlet fever at the age of 5, and what's like living with deafness - the second story the experience of her husband Jim in World War II France where most don't survive the battlefield, and what it's like for Grania and the other families back home.A multilayered story filled with the harsh realities of the world of the deaf and the world of the battlefield, and the compassion,  love and strength of the human spirit to overcome.  Itani is a wonderful writer who gets inside each of these worlds and let the reader have his and her own experience. We become involved in the lives of her characters and we feel their joys and sorrows.

I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment.  The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling.  As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions.  I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down.  Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat.  I won't recommend this book.

In this sensitive portrayal of love and war, author Itani reveals the life of Grania O'Neill from her earliest days in Deseronto, Canada, through her marriage to Jim Lloyd, who serves in the Ambulance Corps during World War I.  Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap.  Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using.  When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex.  By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium.  Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share.  In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming:  pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers.  As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes.  The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends.  Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying.  As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader.  Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot;  Mary Whipple

The title may be Deafening, but the book is anything but.  It's very quiet--too quiet.  As we try to inhabit the life and mind of Grania, deaf since the age of five from scarlet fever, we imagine what it would be like not to know when someone is approaching from behind, or to know when the speaker has changed in a conversation.  This book was just too slow-paced for me and the characters too one-dimensional.  Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault.  More complex is Grania's sister Tress, who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional.  Another interesting character is their mother, who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible, while she battles her guilt over Grania's hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests.  However, the author doesn't fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother, and we are left with a love story between two very nice people.  Jim's story is more disturbing than Grania's, actually, as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis.  His sections of the book are very moving reminders that the lives lost in wars are not just statistics.  The most moving and ironic incident is Jim's wordless interaction with a German counterpart as they both struggle to rescue their wounded on the battlefield.

This is my surprise book of the year. It was a gift, and I didn't quite know what to expect, but it's turned into a real winner.Spanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI, we follow the life of Grania, a child/woman who became deaf following scarlet fever. From a loving middle-class family, she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children, grew into a self-sufficient young woman, became a nurse, and married a hearing man, Jim. He went off to war, as did her childhood friend and brother-in-law, Kenan. Improbably for that Great War, both men returned - but in very different conditions.Divided into several parts, the early chapters are Grania's education, learning to live as a deaf person in the world of the hearing. The next part is Jim's story of his war experience.Then comes Grania's ultimately successful efforts to return the power of speech to her mute and traumatized childhood friend. And finally the resolution of all the stories.This book grows on you. One of the boldest risks author Itani took was to try (successfully) to convey Grania's silent world to readers, and to imitate the understanding of sign language as well as lip reading for those of us unfamiliar with the Deaf World.It's a stunning and powerful book, showing the power of Story to convey love, union, and understanding - and ultimately, joy.

I really enjoyed &#34;The Deafening.&#34;  I read it after reading another book by Itani which I really enjoyed.  Like most Americans I don't know as much about Canada as I should.  The novel grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it to the end.  It also made me feel so lucky that I have my hearing.  The scenes of the hardships of the men fighting WW1 were difficult to read, but that is war and I think it is something we all should think about.

A great novel!This  book, by Francis Itani, revolves around the world of a girl/woman who as acquired deafness through childhood illness. The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.I must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.As with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing.  The prose just seemed to flow effortlessly off the pages as time melted away. You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before;  you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.There are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)All in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books. If I had to compare it to another book for quality, beauty and heartrending appeal, then I'd pick Charles Frazier's " Cold Mountain". Both books have that intangible timeless aura to them that separate them from their peers.Highly recommended!

Canadian author Frances Itani had a promising idea to write about the education and early life of a girl struck deaf in infancy, as her own grandmother was at the turn of the last century. And it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in World War I. The novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.Grania O'Neill -- the name is an anglicization of the Irish for "love" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. She wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. She has an ally in her grandmother Mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. But I found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into Grania's world. I was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.As a young adult, Grania falls in love and marries. But it is 1915, and her husband Jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. The unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as Sebastian Faulks'BIRDSONG. And the scenes back in Canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. But the fact remains that there is an ocean between Grania and Jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. Still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and Grania teaches him once more to talk.This is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence. It calls for an almost abstract style that can handle ideas and sensations rather than events -- poetry rather than prose. The steady narrative that Itani offers contains much that will interest and even move its readers, but for this reader at least the most exciting promises are lost.

It is only March and I have already voted this book for my Book of the Year Award, which I normally select toward the end of the year.  This book was beautifully written.  You could see the human emotions coming through the characters and it made me want to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen.  You feel both sorrow and joy in the characters.  Frances Itani knows the human heart and displays it so well on paper.  Great job!  I am going to make this book a part of my permanent library.

The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else.  Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the "abnormal".  The young, autistic Christopher in "Curious Incident" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?Grania, who would have been "Grainne" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania "blend in" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a "Deaf School".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]

If you are interested in what shaped Sir John Franklin before his abortive exploration in the Arctic, McGoogan presents a tour-de-force portrait of his second wife, Jane, an indefatigable traveler and adventurer. I read this book for insights into 19th Century Tasmania and was not disappointed. Excerpts from letters and newspapers give a clear sense of public and private reflections on this colonial period, well complimented by maps, notes, appendices, and illustrations.

I have just finished McGoogan's book about John Rae and his search for the northwest passage. Rae's search also found the first  proof that Franklin and his men had perished in the Arctic. Instead of gratitude, Lady Fgranklin turned on Rae and this is the next book that sheds light on this enduring tragedy. It will be an other 'can't put it down book'.

This book, though long, chronicles an amazing lady for any historical period, but especially Victorian times.  Her wealth, influence and encouragement made wonderful human rights progress in Tasmania, formerly Van Diemen's Land, as well as in her native England.  After her captain husband was deemed lost in his search for the Northwest Passage, she spent over 20 years and millions of dollars searching for answers to what happened to him and his expedition.  In the process she made significant progress and discoveries.  A world traveller when most women rarely left there own local home areas, Lady Franklin is an inspiration for the ages.  The 'revenge' refers not only to her quest to exonerate the false slandering of Lord Franklin's good name and works, but also her victory over a harsh environment of frozen waste.  An amazing read of one amazing lady.

I just finished reading this book.  It is interesting to me that many of the reviews focus on his chapter on Milk.  I didn't take that much from that chapter, but simply that the verdict isn't really out on Milk.  I think he would have done better to address the question of raw or pasteurized--another big subject of debate.  But, that logically must come from the belief first that milk is good for you and I didn't really feel that he made a decisive decision about it though he leaned more towards milk than away from it.There were several things I enjoyed about this book.  I enjoyed learning a lot of nutritional history--like the history of vitamins and how different things in our food (like canola oil) were developed.  There were also interesting chapters about various vitamins.  I now finally understand why there are vitamins B6 and B12, but not B7 and B8 (they were originally named and then discarded because people realized they had no nutritional value).  There was a very interesting (to me) chapter about detox diets and the lack of scientific evidence that they do any good.  In fact, there is no evidence that there are health benefits to them.But, the reason I haven't given it 4 or 5 stars, is that the author leans heavily towards the opinion that chemicals in our food is just fine.  Even given his scientific evidence, I am not fully persuaded.  Many of the things he talked about haven't been around for years, so we don't know their long term effects.  It was just this year that several reports were published stating that artificial sweeteners are digested the same as regular sugar and do not contribute to weightloss.  Which, by the way, I was very surprised that he didn't talk about Splenda at all but he did talk about other artificial sweeteners.  I did notice after another reviewer mentioned it that studies are mentioned, but not footnoted or identified in an appendix at the back of the book.

Although the premise of the book is sound - to examine the accuracy of common food beliefs - the work is unimpressive and completely unhelpful. There's plenty of scientific research quoted, but some of the nutrition information and "conclusions" about various foods is wrong or terribly misleading. No matter what your interest is in reading about food and nutrition, you will be better served by skipping this book and opting for something else.

Near the end of the book, Joe Schwarcz quotes Mark Twain's famous maxim that "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."  If (some of) the reviews for this book are any indication, Dr. Joe was right: scientific scrutiny is unlikely to change anyone's mind.  People continue to smoke, people continue to eat mostly red meat, etc.  Those people who eat red meat and smoke are often willing to admit they are participating in unhealthy behaviour.  So much more, then, is it difficult or impossible to convince people through the scientific literature that their preconceived notions are not correct when the topic is not something for which literally billions of people have served as experimental subjects (through their normal activities).  That is an observation that is mostly independent of the book's qualities as prose and entertainment, but it does identify the point from which this book starts.In a series of bite-sized chapters (3-5 pages), Schwarcz takes us through some of the topics he's encountered and researched in his role as a science commentator over the last 30 (?) years.  As such, I would suggest that the topics are a little skewed to the supplements side - there are many chapters devoted to particular dietary supplements with supposedly miraculous effects (to cure cancer, lose weight, etc.).  These claims are usually laughably easy to dismiss because the "evidence" of their efficacy is non-existent.  The book is much more interesting when he tackles issues of pesticides, teflon, and artificial sweeteners.  Generally, the scientific literature shows that the amounts of these items in an average diet are so small as to be non-issues.  Sure, they cause cancer - in amounts millions of times as large as humans take in.  And these amounts are far less than the naturally occurring carcinogens that we are exposed to automatically because we breath and eat food.  This leads to the primary thesis of the book, with which no nutritional expert could argue: eat a good balanced diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.This thesis is proven again and again throughout the book, and the primary problem of this book is its repetative nature.  In trying to keep each chapter reasonably autonomous, and because the conclusions are virtually the same each time, the author cannot possibly make the book entertaining for long reading times.  It's more of a "pick up, read a bit, put down for a couple days" kind of book.Other reviewers have objected to the lack of footnotes.  This is a valid criticism; I suppose it was a conscious choice on the author's and editor's parts (for ease of readability).  Certainly I would have prefered if the studies he cites were more clearly referenced.  (Rise and Fall of the Third Reich had thousands of references, so it's insulting to think that the reader would pass on buying the book simply because they are in there, especially as this book's raison d'etre is to bring to the public the objective scientific conclusions on the nutritional questions raised in the book).  I would add the criticism that two hot-button nutritional issues are not dealt with.  (1) Bisphenol-A, a monomer used in polycarbonate synthesis, has been banned by Health Canada and others, but ruled safe (in the amounts present in polycarbonate drinking and storage vessels) by the FDA.  Based on the number of articles I see (in newspapers and even the American Chemical Society's magazine), this chemical is perfectly positioned for the Dr. Joe treatment, and I find it curious that it is omitted.  (2) Perhaps because this movement has only gained real traction since the book was written it was not included, but the "eat local" mantra is in conflict with the "eat lots of variety" mantra espoused by nutritionists and featured prominently in the book.  If you live in a breadbasket (e.g. California), you can have a widely varied diet throughout the year.  If you live in a northern clime (e.g. northern Minnesota, most of Canada), you will not have access to locally grown fresh fruit and veggies for most of the year.  Eating as Dr. Schwarcz suggests would leave you with an enormous carbon footprint due to the transportation and refrigeration costs of moving the food from southern locations.It is also curious that Dr. Joe never mentions the placebo effect.  Some remedies are effective because the patient thinks they will be effective.  Sure, double-blind studies take this into account (people receiving the placebo and the test compound are both going to benefit from the placebo effect, so any additional effect in the test group will be due to the efficacy of the test compound), but anecdotal "evidence" is easy to accumulate by charletons, and these testamonials can certainly be true!  If you're one of the lucky ones whose cancer goes into remission at the same time as you started drinking three litres of acai juice a day, you will certainly "know" that the acai juice caused the remission.  So it's my unfortunate conclusion that Dr. Joe is singing to the choir with this book - those with a scientific/statistical background will be convinced, but we were convinced anyways.  Those who are the statistical outliers will still be convinced of their positions, and the charletans will continue to make money off of them.

"Phew! That was a lot to digest, wasn't it?"Those are the words author Joe Schwarcz uses at the conclusion of his book which is jam-packed with the latest data, debates, and drama about the foods (and chemicals &lt;gasp!> therein) we eat. His book is indeed a full-course meal...and then some.First, he leads us through a tour of naturally occurring substances in our food supply, including flax, fiber,  omega-3 fats, antioxidants, flavanols, vitamins, and minerals. Next, he presents the most controversial issues related to the manipulation of our food supply: fortifying with  iron and fluoride;  sweetening with natural and artificial sweeteners; manipulating genes in our food; and preserving with sulphites, viruses, and radiation. Then, he takes us up close and personal with the contaminants in our food supply, including pesticides, hormones, BPA, PCBs, and dioxins. And, finally, Joe leads us through the nutritional hype surrounding some of the latest nutritional fads such as goji juice, detoxing, DHEA, and green tea.It's likely your head will be spinning after consuming all the nutritional chemistry, controversy and and commentary that Joe serves up. (And, to answer his question above: yes, it is a lot to digest!) He does do an impressive job in guiding us through the maze of myths, misconceptions and truths about the foods we eat, but--as food science is rarely a conclusive one--be prepared to be confused at times.  Fortunately, Joe offers relief at the end of the book, to help us digest it all:"There is more to life than worrying about every morsel of food we put into our mouths. What matters is the overall diet...When you carefully scrutinize the scientific studies that are being rolled out almost on a daily basis, most amount to no more than tinkering with the basic nutritional principles we have tried to lay down: eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, and don't overeat."Whew.

In "An Apple a Day" the McGill University professor Joe Schwarcz offers salient useful nutritional advice.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate.  Emphasize variety and balance in your diet.  Avoid processed foods, especially those high in fat, sugar, and salt.  Exercise.  There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet.That's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book.  I have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being Dr. Schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there:  organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on.  It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis:  that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle.  There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement.  Quite the opposite:  eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  Seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health.

Most of us don't know what to eat anymore with all the marketing out there, this book touches on a lot of subjects, I suppose it would be hard to go in-depth and keep the book under 500 pages.  I enjoyed it, you can read it bit by bit and look for certain information or you can go cover to cover.  An easy read.  It doesn't answer all my questions but at this point, I don't think anything will :)Also - fast shipping and a great price.

Schwarcz is a Professor of Chemistry who has written several books about diet and nutrition. Judging by this book I'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.I'm not saying that Schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?I majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can't really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about "the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat." Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be "an occasional treat," and even then the portion size "should cover a small portion of the plate." Those people who still believe in the "myth" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz's book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.I can't forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that "Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy." Schwarcz responds by saying, "True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle." He leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the "very different diet and lifestyle" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study "which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures." Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who "criticizes" milk consumption as part of the "antimilk lobby," driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we "look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium." Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses "antimilk" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).This is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that "leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health."? I'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk "is not a poison," as some fringe members of PETA might say.In conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. You know the drill: Eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest. If you do all that don't worry about whatever else you like to eat!

I bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books at amazon.ca. I've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled "Milk and Calcium", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a "nutrition authority".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.Don't Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World's Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, "Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!" He fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, "But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture"."The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning."( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the "breast milk" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) "That's hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either."He tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this "self-selected subgroup". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a "trace of dioxin". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring "water" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, "A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup."Of course he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their "natural" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while "milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA".Webster's Dictionary defines poison as, "a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill".It's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While "milk and calcium" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility. Do I now trust or care what he says about fluoride added to tap water? No!Who do I trust?If you want to know what the medical literature says about diet and health, read Joel Fuhrman'sEat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss

I am continually puzzled by the publishing industry's "prizes."  This book takes up an astonishing amount of shelf space in book stores.  Cover to cover there is nothing in it.  It is like reading a cut and paste book.  The characters are thin, flavorless, cliched, sleep-inducing.  The same with the dialogue.  I am still trying to determine what the author's purpose was, unless it was to bore us to tears (those would be the only tears shed).  I felt like it was written by an automaton, someone who does not care about the craft of writing but thinks she is precious.  There is no strength to the story or the sentences.  I actually felt insulted by this drivel.Read The Deptford Trilogy, by Robertson Davies.  Now there is a circus story you won't forget.

I wasn't sure about this book after some of the reviews, etc. I guess the whole circus thing wasn't of interest to me, and so I put off buying this title for months. But last week, I gave in when it was listed at a phenomenal price. And I have to say, I loved it!It is by far the best thing I have read on my Kindle. Exciting, romantic, adventurous and slightly sorrowful at times. The characters were unforgettable. I adore Jacob at age 21 (and age 93) and he is a wonderful protagonist. This book is about circus life and the tragedy of a young man, but it is a love story as well. It is also filled with creatures great and small. So would I recommend this? Yes... because Water For Elephants is fabulous.

I loved how Jacob found an opportunity in the mist of his grieving over his parents' death.  He completely turned his life around for the better.  This book was not only a love story for me, but it was a book of adventure.  It had me sitting on the edge of my seat a few times during my read.  I like how the book takes you back to Jacob's past & present.  The ending of the book was completely unexpected for me.  I did not see it coming, but it's where Jacob belongs.

Jacob's life takes a drastic turn when his parents die. Stripped of everything he owns, everything familiar to him, all the comforts of his college and family life that he took for granted, he leaves his old life behind, jumps a train that turns out to be a circus train, and enters a totally new, different world. A circus is fun, right? Not behind the scenes, in this book. Jacob, a young adult, naive, still a virgin, unused to such a hard life on the road, confronts danger, murder, hatred, love, callous human viciousness, more danger, and finds friends and allies (not all of them human) in the unlikeliest of places.The story is told in turn, by the nonogenarian Jacob now in a nursing home, and at other times, by the twenty-something Jacob working at the circus and trying not to get killed -- mostly at the hands of his fellow-human-associates. Every chapter is an adventure, held my attention and took turns gladdening, saddening and surprising me.The circus animals also get into the act in this book and the author's sensitive rendering and treatment of them makes them all the more vivid, as "supporting actors",  Circus "employees", and fellow participants in the intrigue and action.A masterful ending -- leaving the reader with hope, glee and wonder. The very informative afterword by the author left me wanting to do my own research into this fascinating subject of the Circus.

What can I say? I'm not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book. From the prologue, this book held my attention. Gruen's writing style and attention to detail is simply amazing! At several points, I felt as though I was actually watching the show or walking beside Jacob while working in the menagerie. It felt real. And the perverse, morbid sense of humor she gives Jacob as an elderly gentleman is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Although, I must admit, I found myself fuming over the treatment of our senior citizens. That, however, is a rant for another time!The characters in this book are so rich and deep. It was hard not to form some sort of fondness for them. In addition, I found it amazing that Gruen was able to turn Rosie into a full character without completely humanizing her. Even though I have a strong bond to animals, I still felt a close connection to Rosie.From a lot of her terminology, knowledge of trains, animals, freaks, etc., I really think that Gruen did a lot of research before writing this book. It makes it a lot more authoritative and realistic. While the story itself is fiction, it makes it that much more believable and credible to be interspersed with fact.I will say that the happy ending, Jacob's extreme sensitivity, etc. might be seen as extremely campy. However, I felt that Gruen was trying to find something positive during the Depression. I feel that she did try to capture that, even though there was food a shelter, life on a train circus was not good either. The Depression was hard on everyone, and no one was left unaffected. So, while there was romanticizing occurring in the novel, it felt as though she was trying to make a fairytale in an unlikely setting. To me, that makes it even more endearing and tender. Many reviews I have read complain that she is trying to push an agenda with some of the issues she tackles, but, to me, this was just a romantic love story of two people finding each other against all odds. I do, however, have to laugh a little at the ending. That part might have been a bit over the top

This is really a fun read. The story is interesting, the writing flows easily, the characters are real and believable, and even though I thought a story about a circus during the depression era might be depressing, it was extremely interesting. I really enjoyed it and have placed it amongst my 'keepers.'

As always, the book was better than the movie. The movie was far too simple. The characters are actually very well developed in the book, with much better dialogue (that wasnt ruined by actors). Yes, I guess it's a romance novel, but not in a Nicholas Sparks kind of way. I think it's enjoyable for all audiences.

When I picked up Water for Elephants, I wasn't quite sure of the topic and was afraid I might have to put this book down - low and behold, it was a great book - very entertaining, the pages just kept turning and I finished the book wanting more!  The story of circus life is like none other, as is this book....

Just finished this book and I thought it was really good.  I thought the circus subject was interesting, along with some romance and I was really pleased.  For the last 25% of the book I was really gripping my kindle, waiting to see what was going to happen next!  This book did not disappoint!

It took me a bit to get into the book, but once I did... I could not put it down. The love story captivated me, and it is not really something you read about every day (the circus), which made it even more interesting.I would have given it 5 stars if I was more captivated when Jacob first joined the circus... even so, I definitely recommend this book!

Wow, where to begin. I literally just finished the novel, and was left with the most beautiful feeling of what it means to capture the essence of humanity. Yes! This is something you don't experience too often, and when you do you want to hold onto the feeling and never let go. I'm not going to give a plot summary, or play by play- that's what the product description and other reviews are for. This is a reaction review. I never really wanted to read this novel when it was all the rage. I would walk past it as I scanned the bookshelves, and ignore it on the best-seller list. However, when I saw the 3,000 reviews and all the positive stars mounting up, I knew people must be onto something. That coupled with my Kindle Fire Christmas present, and this is free in the Kindle Lender's Library.Where to start? From the moment you start reading, you are sucked right into Jacob's world, and the world of the circus. You find yourself running alongside Jacob, and taking part of the daily activities of the circus. The characters are highly developed, and you hate, love, and grow with each one of them. The author takes time to even develop the animals which I feel helps readers bond to the very world they now find themselves in. The story is never short of action, passion, compassion, suspense, and so much more-often at the same time. I found myself holding my breath for long durations of the novel anxiously awaiting what happens next.train In short, this novel is simply beautiful.

I'm going to be careful here, because I don't want to spoil anything for potential readers.  Let me just say it is a great book, sometimes disturbing, but often funny and charming, or filled with action.  It also has a good bit of grit and tenacity in the main character.  It is a look inside a unique community that you wouldn't get a chance to view this close if you weren't being "escorted" by  one of their own.  You may be tempted to stop reading at some point if you are an excessively tender soul, however hang in there.  All you need to know for now is this, it is a fresh well-written book that you will love and ends in a good way so, have no fear of it and enjoy.

I am very interested in the time period of this story and setting. I am refreshed by their hard times, their often cruel lives and how they could even make it from day to day. There was one moment early in the book, I almost laid it down and didn't pick it up for it was so oppressive to me. I am an avid animal lover so I felt a double punch to the gut. Yes, I cried. Overall, it was a journey, through hard times...but you know what? They made it, and will continue.

I found some of the "old-timey" phrases and circus lingo a bit difficult. I had to use the kindle dictionary as much as I could but most things weren't in there. I am still kind of confused about what "red lighted" really is. I need to Google that phrase. Anyway, beside the lingo I found a really interesting story. I never really think this about a book but I kind of wish this book were longer. I wanted to know more about the key relationship that the author creates. She really could do another book with material I think she left out, like what happens next.I recommend this book, especially if you are looking forward to the movie with Reese Witherspoon, Robert Pattinson, and Christopher Waltz.

I didn't mean to inhale this in two days. It's the first book for a book club my two best friends in NYC and I are starting, and we gave ourselves a month to finish it. Two of us have completed it less than a week after it was assigned.The book tells the story of Jacob, now old, reminiscing about his life as part of a circus. It's an easy read, and no literary feat by any means, but it's a good read all the same. Its 300-plus pages fly by, and in them, you begin to feel like you're a part of the circus, understanding what it's like to work behind the scenes. It discusses the meaning of love, towards both humans and animals, and honour: what do you owe the people around you?The parts I loved best, though, and that touched me the most weren't the love story: I've seen too many of its kind before. No, it was the discussion of aging that got to me and made me cry so hard in the last two pages I woke my boyfriend up: what does it mean to age? What does your family owe you as you age? And what does your life mean when you're ninety-something, in a nursery home, and alone except for your memories? These questions terrify me: they wrack me with guilt and fear, and in raising them, this book became something more than a beach read. I don't think I'll think of Rosie too much, or Bobo; I don't think I'll remember Jacob or Marlena too often, either. But I will remember Jacob's struggles in the nursing home, and where we leave him when the book ends.

Since I've never written a review on Amazon, you can bet it would take one heck of a book to get me to do it. Water for Elephants is that book. I buy a LOT of books, and with most of them I'm left feeling dissatisfied. But with this book I read it over a weekend and just tore through it. Solid writing, thorough research, believable characters, and a great story. I just love this book! As a fan of HBO's Carnivale, it reminded me a lot of that series, but make no mistake, this is NOT a derivative work. I'm just hoping that Gruen will return to this universe in the near future and give us another installment.

I have not seen the movie and was not sure how I'd like a book about the circus but a lot of people recommended this novel and it got great reviews so I gave it a try. It was beautifully written with vivid imagery. How could you not fall in love with Jacob? How could you not be enterained with the stories about the circus? How could you not be enthralled with Marlena and Jacob's secret love? I really enjoyed reading it, in fact I could not put it down and it only took me a week to read it. I think this is a story anyone could enjoy, and the author did an amazing job with her research about everything from the circus to the prohibition. The parts about the old man got kind of depressing but there was a happy ending for all at the end. Highly recommended. Lovely read.

This is a fabulous story, written with humor, compassion and profound insight. We are first presented with Jacob Jankowski as an elderly man in a nursing home. The old coot may have problems with his short-term memory, but he certainly has a terrific long-term memory when it comes to remembering the details of his youthful days in a travelling circus. I thought that I had no interest whatsoever in the workings of a depression-era circus, including the care of the exotic animals and the various freaks and acts. However, the author depicts this unique microcosm of humanity with such passion and color that I found myself absolutely absorbed in the story early on.Adding to the historic ambience of this saga are the well-chosen photographs at the start of each chapter: a man with a deformed human growing from his stomach; a woman proudly showing off her bare upper extremities; excited people milling around the big top...It is the undercurrent of spiritual darkness that makes this story fly so high. Gruen depicts the battle between good and evil with stunning accuracy: the greed of Uncle Al; the brutality of August; the surprising kindness of the abandonned dwarf, Walter; and the meek vulnerability of Marlena and her animals.The scene with the drunkard Camel being told that he is dying of poisoning from Jamacai ginger extract is poignant. This, followed by scenes with Camel being cared for in a box car by Walter and Jacob. Stirring, because alternating chapters depict a now elderly Jacob in a similar position of helplessness.In sum, a GREAT book. Whoever thought that an elephant would carry such literary weight? (No pun intended.) I am totally baffled by some of the very negative critiques it has received on Amazon, only to be followed by 5 star praises. Some have said it is poorly written. Are we reading the same story?

I understand some of the criticism, but does a book have to be a literary masterpiece to be immensely enjoyable?  The overwhelming positive reviews explain why not.It is well researched, but maybe the plot stretched a bit too far at times and low quality dialogues have taken away from the book's otherwise star quality.The depression era was well represented, gave a good realistic feel of the troubled times and the people.  Circus setting was pure genius, and made it so interesting.Overall, it is a very enjoyable book, very readable.

Every once in a while, there's a book that seems written for you. It speaks to you in a way books you love haven't. You don't just visualize the author's words, they leap off the page, and rather than watching the movie in your mind, you are living it. You feel the pain, the joy, the laughter. When the book is finished, you're more than disappointed. You feel invigorated, and you search eagerly through the author's books to see what, along the same vein, she has to offer. You search readers' recommendations to find the books that leave the same imprint on you. Inevitably, though the books satiate your appetite, they don't resonate in the same way. Welcome to Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants.In the prologue, we're privy to a murder. We see it as Jacob sees it, and tries in vain to stop it. Though the victim and murderer aren't named, as we're introduced to them, it becomes clear in our mind who filled those roles.Then we start from the beginning, in the midst of the Great Depression. Jacob is in class, during the final few weeks at Cornell preparing for his finals before he becomes a doctor of veterinary medicine.In a moment, the Dean will enter and change his path. Jacob was to go home and set up shop with his father, working with the animals in his town. Instead, he goes home to identify the remains of his mother and father. He sees the sign his father added to their on-site practice: Jankowitz and Son Veterinary Practice. After identifying his family, he visits the lawyer, who tells him he has nothing. The bank owns the house and everything in it. The explanation as to why his parents mortgaged the house shatters him. He returns to school to finish his finals and finds that he can't.Jacob flees and seeing a train pass, tries to jump aboard. Once on, he realizes it is a circus train. An old man, Camel, vouches for him and works to get him a job within.As soon as the boss finds he is Ivy League educated, degree or no degree, he becomes the animal man. With such a prestigious job within, he straddles the division between the higher ups and performers, and the lower echelon who helped secure his place.One performer in particular, Marlena, fascinates him. She reminds him physically of the girl he left behind at school, and emotionally captivates him. She matches his love of animals. Married to August, who has the boss' ear, she is off-limits, but a friendship develops anyway.Later comes Rosie, an elephant pilfered from a circus that has gone defunct. Rosie suffers August's wrath many, many times. Jacob is stunned by her human like qualities. Understanding, pain, anger, empathy, happiness all emanate from her big brown eyes.Following the story, I felt all of the emotions Rosie feels (except perhaps, the pain). Astonishment at the goings on to keep the circus running smoothly. The love Jacob develops for many people who help him in the course of creating a new life for himself, free of the memories surrounding his past. Sadness at the loss of animals, anger at the treatment of the animals and the red lighting of, as they're called today, carnies.The characters came alive to me, as did the setting. As soon as I finished this book, I eagerly went to Sara Gruen's website to read excerpts of other novels she had written. While good, they didn't capture me the way this did. And I wanted more of this. So I went to Amazon's recommendations Disappointedly, I moved on to Barnes and Noble. No dice. So I tried the next best thing. Research. I wanted to read first hand accounts of the circus the way it was back then. The more I read, the more I craved.Then, as though they knew my hunger, work offered me discounted tickets to the circus. I'm still debating. On the one hand, it's the circus. Elephants that feel things like people do! Horses that synchronize! How can I say no? On the other hand, it's not the 1920s. It's almost 100 years later. What if it's not the same? I mean true, we're in the middle of a depression (point 4 of pros: It's almost the same!). But people are categorically different than they were then. Theoretically, this extends to performers as well right?But alas, I have chosen to forego the circus at this moment, because I fear, like the recommendations of Barnes and Noble and Amazon, it may fall short. So I will hold onto the satisfaction this book gave me, and the hunger for more of the same. Hopefully, there will be another book that catches my attention like this one. And soon.

I got WATER FOR ELEPHANTS as a gift from my husband. When I opened it I said to myself, why on earth did he buy me this? I aked him what prompted him to chose it - he said because I've had a life long fascination with Freak Shows and they're part of the Circus. OK. Fair enough.If it hadn't been for him buying it for me I would have missed out on what has become my favorite piece of fiction I have ever read.I am in love with this book.This book is enchanting. The characters are, variously, loveable, hateworthy, pathetic, nasty and dastardly.Sara Gruen knows her characters so well and writes them with such passion they seem real. You will feel that you know them too. And the writing is so vivid you will feel like you're standing ring-side. Inhale deeply - can you smell the cotton candy?And the ending of this book is the most perfect, satisfying ending I have ever, ever read.I'm not going to pigeon-hole it with category or genre and risk putting some people off...like me.There are some Book Club talking points at the end of the paperback version and one such talking point is to discuss the book's 'pathetic glamour.' That is a perfect descriptor. The circus fakes its glamour and its glitz; the daily lives of the crews who work it are anything but, and at times are brutal, harrowing, even.I've learned a valuable lesson from this book - what I want as a reader is just writing that takes my breath away. I got that from WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.

This is a well told, interesting story.  It  belongs in the historical fiction genre; the subject is the travelling circuses which tried to make a financial go of it during the Great Depression.  It is not a pretty picture, but as in much of historical fiction, it has a virtuous hero, and a very upbeat ending.  It also has an added dimension: the story is told by the hero as he resides in a nursing home, and suffers from the condescending  attitudes toward the patients there.  This aspect of the book was particularly good, and for me the most genuinely moving.  For that reason, I wish the author hadn't felt the need to give even this sub-plot such a "nice" ending.

Book DescriptionAs a young man, Jacob Jankowski was tossed by Fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm. We guarantee you will not be able to put this one down!

This is not really a particularly intellectual book, or the kind that will have you pondering but it will hold your interest and enthrall you; which makes it a perfect holiday read. It is not only a fantastic love story but is a seemingly accurate depiction of circus life during Great Depression (so you still get to learn things after all)and has enough plot to hold your interest but not so much as to seem over engineered. There is even a lesson about how we should treat old people.A good read

Jacob Jankowski is a student at Cornell University, studying veterinary medicine so that he can join his father's practice.Near the end of his senior year and before he sits for his final exams, he is called into the dean's office and told his parents have been killed in an automobile accident. When he returns home to bury them, he learns that his father is bankrupt and all he inherits is debts. After the funeral he returns to Cornell where his room and board have been paid up until the end of the year. He tries to sit for his final exams but ends up leaving without answering a single question. He walks away from the college and finally jumps aboard a railroad car and begins what will be an unusual life, a hard life, and exciting life with a circus.The story is told by Jacob when he is an old man living in a rest home. It is a depiction of life during the hard years of the Great Depression, the even harder life as a member of a traveling circus, and also provides a peek into the life of early rest homes.I found the book to be a little raw in spots but also exciting and entertaining because I remember the traveling circuses with the big top tents and the intriguing side shows which, as a child, I was never allowed to see.

I was eager to read this book after all of the praise it has received. I wasn't necessarily disappointed but not exactly getting all the hype. I enjoyed the visual scenes that Gruen painted and could easily picture it. I just couldn't get past the story.  I didn't feel an immediate chemistry between Jacob and Marlena. I'm sorry if most other people disagree with me, but the 'heat' just wasn't truly there for me. At times I almost felt that Jacob only attracted Marlena due to his difference to August, not due to the actual love between them. While I also enjoyed the perspective of Jacob as an old man remembering his story, it really just left me sad whenever I read scenes from the older Jacob's perspective. He seemed so unhappy and it made me feel as if I were reading two stories, one with a happy ending and one with a sad ending. In all, I gave this story 3 stars because I felt that perhaps if it wasn't being sold as a love story I would have appreciated it more. Instead I am left wondering what was so noteworthy about the characters love beyond the fact that they supposedly found love while working on a circus.

Water for Elephants has a quality so many modern novels are lacking, and that is an sense of enchantment. So many novels these days take you to a place you would really rather not be, but even the scruffy world of the down-and-out traveling circus is full of mystery and--dare I say it--soul. Love doesn't hurt, either. My 84-year-old mother dislikes modern novels (too much bad language) but she loved this one.

There are books you read for the story, and books you read for the writing.  Water for Elephants is of the former variety.  It's a quick read and a good read, but it is not a great book.Ms. Gruen was thorough in her research, so the reader does get some feeling for the gritty world of the "train circus", yet I felt when I finished the book that I had no clear sense of who the characters were.  Jacob is a nebulous character as a young man, and a shallow one in old age.  As for the rest of the "cast", well, when they are good they are very very good, and when they are bad they are...monsters.  Rosie the elephant is one of the more developed characters!The author doesn't seem to have a good ear for speech, either.  Any of the book's dialog could come from any character's mouth, for the most part, and some of the things Jacob says (or says in his mind) as an old man seem to land with a clunk.  They just don't fit.Add to that a slightly corny ending and a structure that comes out of any pulp murder mystery (old person recalling a murder, then going back to the start of the story and working back up to the murder...with a twist), and you get just a middling-good book.I am vehemently against the use (abuse) of animals in circuses, so I was happy to see that animal abuse was part of this story.  In fact, I think the author cleaned it up a bit too much (few facts about the orangutan and the chimpanzee, for instance..it's sickening what the higher apes were subject to, and still are).  What I think she could have cut back on is the gratuitous details about sex and the cooch tent.  That all seemed tacked on and unnessesary.Overall, I consider this book worth reading, but I don't see what all the excitement is about.  If you really want a feeling for circus sideshow life, read the novel Geek Love.

Skip the prologue and just start the story. Reading it won't hurt, but I felt a little tricked. And it was such a good story on its own. Love the old photos of the circus. Gruen did a great job with her research, I felt like I was there in a way that doesn't happen often.

It was a good book, with parts that sort of jarred my sensibilities.  I enjoyed the story and the backdrop to it.  I learned more about early American Circus.  I also liked the elderly aspect to it as well.  I would not read it again, but I would discourage some one else reading it.  Once I started, I could not stop.

In addition to writing an engaging story that offers a glimpse into a fascinating world foreign to most of us, Ms. Gruen shows herself to be a master "architect" with this novel, crafting a story that flows seamlessly between two radically different eras in her protagonist's life. The book starts with a flashback, so you know at some point it's going to bring us back to the opening scene. But Ms. Gruen does so in such a surprising and unexpected way, with a twist that left my jaw on the floor. It's not an exaggeration to say I was stunned.With Riding Lessons and Flying Changes, Ms. Gruen proved she was capable of writing good commercial fiction.With Water For Elephants, she proves herself capable of writing a great American novel.

I got the Audible version of this book because I was curious about its incredible popularity and wanted to see what I was missing. Having finished, I'm mystified about the huge number of five-star reviews.I don't know much about circuses so I can't comment on the quality of the author's research efforts, although I see other reviewers have pointed out shortcomings. What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It's never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn't tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own "love" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don't want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that I strongly believe that Jacob, the narrator and main character, absolutely positively does NOT deserve the long and largely happy life he'll eventually get to lead. It's one thing to care about animals and less fortunate humans. That test, Jacob passes with flying colors. But when it comes to moderating one's own urges and balancing them against the well-being of others (all others close to you, not just Marlena, the love interest), Jacob gets a huge F-.

I bought this book when it first came out, because of the exceptional reviews I read.  I have never finished this book.  I started it, shelved it, read three books, went back to it and I just could not foster up enough interest to continue reading.  The story line is uninteresting and the characters were dull. I finally accepted that I would not likely ever to read it; so I tried to sell the book back to the store. The book store did not accept it because this item was not moving from the shelves!  It was definitely not worth the money I spent on this item.

I just finished reading this book and I loved it! I put off reading this book for about a year because I thought it was about a circus and I'm not a fan of circuses because of the history of maltreatment of the animals within circuses. I thought it was about a circus but I was wrong, it was about much more than that. It was a wonderful read and I recommend to everyone.

This book is a quick read and a must for any summer reading list.  I read it while in a book group but devoured it and then went looking for more wishing that the story would go on.  A lovely story of a young man's life with the traveling circus amid the depression.  Having never read anything on the life of a circus traveler it was eye opening and riveting.

With the making of a Film based on this book and all of the rave reviews about it, I guess I had high expectations.  Don't get me wrong, I found most of it entertaining, but I think the story lacked in its development, and I never figured out why religion was ever even brought up among the characters in the earlier part of the book, when it apparently had nothing to do with the plot. The ending was also a bit of a let-down because it was just too "happily ever after" for me.The funny thing is that I'm not a big fan of Circuses in general, but surprisingly, I found the source material to be rather fascinating,  So, if anything, this book will propel me to look into more historical reading material on Circuses from the 19th century to the turn of the 20th Century.

I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end.

and take a look at &#34;behind the scene&#34; of a &#34;train&#34; circus from a long ago era.  The book appears to be impeccably researched and the author has drawn on some stories that contribute to the books entertainment value and poignancy.Earlier reviewers have already provided a look into the plot so no need to reiterate.  I devoured the book in about three days and place it in the top 10 books read within the last year.  I found the characters, both human and animal, brought vividly to life and in a way that really made me care about them.  The ending might be a bit of a stretch for some but somehow so very appropriate.  Water for Elephants is definitely worth the time to read, imho.

I found "Water for Elephants" extremely entertaining, despite never seeing a circus or having any interest in the subject.  The backdrop is the 1930's, and the book throws you into the era of carnivals, Prohibition, and the Great Depression.  You're led by slums with hobos, and everyone is dying for regular pay and something to eat.The story bounces back and forth between a man living out his twilight years in a nursing home, and his 23-year-old self... where circumstances find him joining a circus.  Life revolves around the train for these guys - they always travel in cramped space with all kinds of memorable characters.There are some great anecdotes so strange you'd think they were true.  My favorite was Rosie the bull elephant sneaking lemonade by pulling her stake out of the ground, and then being smart enough to replace it to avoid getting caught.The author respects the reader enough to let him figure out what's happening from contextual clues.  For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed.  You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz).  Note that there are some graphic sexual encounters and profanity that make this mature with a capital "M" - don't give it to anyone younger than a high school kid.

This book has been on my to-read list for quite some time and I finally got around to reading it. I would have to agree with the majority of the reivews in that it certainly was an excellent and entertaining story. I am especially looking forward to seeing the movie now that recently came out.I liked how the story flipped from present-day Jacob who was 93 years old in a nursing home to the story of young Jacob on the circus train. The first part of the story of the events leading to how Jacob comes to join the circus in the first place really get the story going and draw the reader's interest. There is a fair amount of sexual content within the story that surprised me a little but was in keeping with the progression of the story. I didn't particularly enjoy the portrayals of animal abuse that happened on the circus train, but these also helped in building the storyline of August and Rosie (the elephant).I was pleased by how the story wrapped up and am definitely interested in checking out some of the other books by this author.

This story helped me in gaining a better understanding of what it is to be elderly.  The audio version is narrated by two men, both are meant to be the main character, one voice representing his twenties and the other is in his nineties.  It certainly isn't centered around being of an advanced age, but as a side story, it was still very clear.I was pleasantly surprised by my conflicted response to the story.  On the one hand, his lamentations over being at the end of his life made me sad; on the other hand, he was funny and his life was a full one, giving him many wonderful memories.My advice to a prospective listener or reader?  If you are bored with the first chapter, hang in there, it picks up and is worth getting to the end.

Water for Elephants is a love story set in a post depression traveling circus and told from the memory of 93 year-old man.  The story jumps between the current life of the narrator a uncontented man who believes he is 90 or 93 and his rememberance of the love story between Jacob and the Benzini Brother's circus.After the death of both his parents Jacob a veterinairian student finds himself penniless. Although not intentionally  he runs away to the circus where he finds love.This story give great historical flavor and is a must read.

Water for Elephants is a tough one for me to review. I loved the theme and the split realities of it. You are basically following Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, through two of his life's biggest adventures. We are introduced to him at the circus and follow his story of how he becomes a vet for the Benzini Brother's traveling circus. We are also switching back into his current reality where he is re-living these days from the nursing home that he now resides in.There are good plot points throughout, and I did find myself wanting to get back to the book to see what happens next. At times, however, I found certain events did not play out in a way that was realistic to the story that was being built. Even though I was enjoying the story and the narrative - I found myself aware of the fact that there was an author behind it all, pulling the strings. Not being able to quite put my finger on why, I was often pulled out of believing the story, almost as if the author was showing too many fingerprints of the process of writing. For this reason - it was hard for me to get lost completely in the book itself.All of that aside, however, I still found it beautiful. There was a moment in particular when I felt incredibly sad for our main character - to the point where I had to put the book down and step away for a moment to collect myself. There is a wonderfully commentary woven throughout that allows the reader to ponder where one is at when you are looking back at your life in old age. I really enjoyed that thread.I had heard a lot of really good things about the book, and was going into it that way. Unfortunately, there was something missing for me when I completed it, almost as if I had skipped an important part. For that reason, I give it four stars.

Water for Elephants is first narrated by Jacob, a 90-93 year old living out his days in a nursing home. He begins to tell the story of his life including a 70 (or so) year old secret he's revealing to anyone for the first time. Jacob is a young man just short of taking his tests to become a Veterinarian until both his parents die, and his life seems to hold no direction. He accidently finds himself in the midst of circus train where he meets an unpredictable circus manager, August, his beautiful wife, Marlena, and later a difficult to train elephant, Rosie.The element that lights up this audio book is John Randolph Jones amazing narration as the tired and cantankerous older Jacob. His voice is heavy with age and experience. It would be difficult for any secondary narrator to compete but David LeDoux does a good job of holding his own. Though the setting is lively and obviously well researched, the love triangle is underdeveloped and the end of the book just sort of unravels. At turns mindless, salacious, and fun, Water for Elephants effectively captures a bygone time and offers some fascinating circus details most will enjoy.

I am not by any means a reader or fan of "Mainstream" novels. My tastes tend to lean decidedly toward the stranger side of fiction (Little, PKD, Laymon, etc). But I decided, while strolling the aisle of my local Amazon store, after reading review after review that all but bowed before this title, to try it. I am so glad I did.I tore through this book, not wanting to leave Jacob stranded too long. I just "couldn't put it down", I know how terribly cliche' that is, but it is the absolute truth.This novel made me smile, which normally is a turn off for me... what a nice change of pace. Pick this book up if you haven't already. Sit down with Jacob and listen to his story, you'll smile too.

This book was just so-so for me.  There was a total disconnect for me with any of the characters specifically between Jacob and Marlena.  I thought their love story lacked passion of any kind.  For me, it felt like the only thing keeping them together was the horses and later Rosie.  It wasn't until half way through the book when Jacob finally admits he's in love with her and it's so lackluster I didn't really believe it.  Perhaps I feel this way because I had just finished reading "Wurthering Heights" before this and expecting more passion between the young lovers; however I'm not interested in reading this book again to find out if that's true.......which is saying a lot.  I thought the most interesting part of the book was the Q&A portion at the end where Gruen talks about her research and how all the events that took place on and off the train were based on real events that happened to various circus's during that time.  Knowing that did kind of put those events into prospective, but not really being interested in circus history is where it failed to capture me.  In the end: Big on Circus history, lacking on the love story.  Not one I would recommend unless you like reading and/or learning about the traveling circus.

A friend recommended this book and I was thoroughly engulfed in it from the beginning. Such raw, real life and survival during the depression era. Jacob is a wonderful main character who is thrust into a world, grieving and desolate after his parents sudden death leaves him with nothing. The story is told by him as an old man of 90 or 93 as he says and is truly blunt on how our elders are treated in nursing homes and devalued as human beings. But, the wonderful, painful and thrilling story of his life, his love and his journey after his parents death lands him in a circus is spellbinding.Just know that the ending will make you smile and cry and feel joy for Jacob!

I bought this book orginally when it first came out. It has been sitting on my shelf untill this weekend. I started this book early morning and had it done by the end of the day. I couldn't put it down!I the author does a great job with switching back and forth between times. Alot of authors try and do this but can't acomplish it but this one did a great job.The book held me in suspense the entire time. There never was a down moment in the whole book. Something was alway going on to keep the readers attention. I loved that he did research to write this book. The pictures also helped with what you were imagining as you read it.The author does a good job with making us have a love hate relationship with many of the characters. One minute I wouldn't think someone was that bad and then the next thing they did I couldn't stand them or vice versa.The interaction with the animals brought in a whole different set of characters. Rosie seemed almost human to me.I hated and loved to finish this book. I haven't found something this good in a while.

I had heard a lot of positive comments on this book for a while and thought I would see for myself what all the praise was about.  Well this book deserves 5 stars and more.  It is really a book that will stay with you for a while.  I know it will be among my all time favorites, as well it should.  The writer has done an excellent job fleshing out the people and you almost feel as if you know them personally or have dealt with people like time in real life.  The depression was deep in the US when the story is introduced.  Life can hand out a lot of hard knocks, even to animals.  I really never thought about that aspect of life before. I am very happy I had the opportunity to read this book.  I delayed reading it many times because frankly the title put me off.  Then I remembered to never judge a book by it's title.

I have a tendency of sticking with supernatural stories because I love the magic of them. While "Water for Elephants" is far from supernatural, this story was easily the definition of magical.The story actually starts out in the nursing home, which is so intricately described that I could hear the whirring of the mechanical machines; helping the patients stay alive, and I could smell the putrid scent of finality in the air. Instantly I was pulled in by the lyrical writing style. The author also does a nice job of analyzing life's major questions, and hopping on her train of thought was enjoyable.The unwinding of Jacob's memories is done so beautifully. Gruen achieved what few authors can and brought her characters to life. I almost felt like I was hearing this beautiful, heartbreaking, brave and wonderful story first hand, staring at Jacob's frail body beneath the fluorescent lights of the nursing home.This book took me on a journey, and at the end I wasn't quite ready to hop off the train. There was a twist I never saw coming, and my only regret is it took me so long to pick this one up and read it. I recommend it for people who love a story of adventure, bravery, and love that overcomes all obstacles.

I loved the rich, descriptive language. The author does a great job of the writer's maxim "show, don't tell," revealing bits and pieces to fill in the details and background of characters over time. The main character, Jacob, is very funny, especially when he's a 93-year old with attitude. I felt so sorry for old Jacob after a while. I really wanted to get back to young Jacob and hoped for a happy ending. Without giving anything away, I was incensed at one point about what happened to old Jacob. I hated that part so much that I questioned all the favorable reviews. However, I must say that I'm satisfied with the ending and glad that I read the book. One bonus of the fact that it's a best seller: I was able to easily check this out from my local library after a few week's wait. No problem, I wasn't in a hurry.Regarding adult themes (beware potential SPOILERS below):I'm definitely NOT a fan of inserting graphic sex or nudity or swearing into a story for no reason. I prefer nice clean stories and think you really don't need to be explicit. However, I think the scenes in this story helped set the environment. They were typically treated with such humor that I laughed a lot and didn't mind them. First, young virgin Jacob guards a stripper while she performs. The striptease and gigantic breasts are described in vivid detail. Jacob's horror, amazement, and embarassment, having never seen a naked woman before shows he's really not in Kansas any more. That's the most explicit scene and it's really hilarious. There are a few other sexual situations, often mixed with drinking. The actual love making was left to the imagination. There's a little swearing. I found the beating of animals to be the most objectionable; Jacob, the animal lover, spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to help.

I loved this book.  And to think it was the first from Sara Gruen at that. This is a book that spawned the movie of the same name.  I saw the movie first, then read the book, then saw the movie again. As often happens, the book provides much more color than the movie ever could. For instance, the owner of the circus, Big Al, is shown in the movie in only one scene for a moment giving approval for a purchase.  Sara researched the subject of &#34;train circuses&#34; in detail.  The cruel practices common during the depression to stay in business are shocking, but make riveting reading as the backdrop for this story of growing up, awakening, and goal-seeking.  Highly recommended.

I really enjoyed this book. Sarah Gruen did a great job of telling the story ofcircus with all the beauty, cruelty and the harsh life during the depression.The author states that she did research the circus during that time period and it shows in her writing.  She really describes the  people and animals that were the main part of a circus and they  come to life in my mind. I could see and hear them as I read the book.It starts off with the main character, Jacob Jankowski as a very angry oldman in a nursing home. He decides to go to the circus and reminisces about his past. We are then introduced to the young Jacob Jankowski. The book goes back and forth in time as many do today.The author really nails it when she writes about the depression. I have read and studied the depression and she portrayes it so vividly. I felt so sorry for the workers, performers and the animals. They all suffered in one way or another.The characters had their flaws.The book paints the Ringleader as a charming but violent man. One who had a short fuse and was a loose cannon.I was fascinated by Jacob Jankowski. In spite of the hardships that he had to endure,his kindness and gentleness never wavered.I admired Marlena as a beautiful, graceful and long-suffering woman. She was  not brave enough to leave. I recommend this book to all. The movie followed the book very closely except the Ringleader was not as mean as in the book.

This book grabs you from the minute you pick it up. It has intrigue, dysfunction, love, and amazing human-like emotions in the circus animals (from Rosie the elephant to Queenie the terrier).The movie was great, but the book had so much more depth and character-development.It seems so incredible that anything like this could happen in "real life", even during this period in US history. Tough circus life is described inamazing detail.The lopsided human love triangle adds another dimension to this book and its dysfunction. Would highly recommend this semi-fictional novel.

This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I bought it for my Kindle, but it sat there for months as I wasn't in my "literary" phase.  I finally decided to give it a go, and was so incredibly surprised!  I LOVED this story!  It was filled with so many emotions and the characters are depicted in such a vivid fashion, I could picture them so clearly!  They stayed with me for quite some time after completing the book and that rates VERY high with me.  I even got my husband to read it and he loved it as well.  I really couldn't put it down until I knew just what happened to everyone....and the ending?  AMAZING!!!!  I cried in joy, fulfillment, closure and sadness!  Wonderful read!-Just My Opinion [...]

This novel tells the story of a man who is now old and struggling with health problems. A carnival comes to town and he remembers the amazing life he once had. I loved the ending the most and hated when characters died. The story itself was believable and the characters complex. This book is not for children and can leave you quite depressed at certain points. Other than that [and that's more of an observation than a complaint] this is a solid read. If the characters didn't die this would've been a 5.

This story takes place during the Great Depression.  It is a love story, but also a story about life with a traveling circus and all the rawness and crudeness that goes along with being part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth as remembered by Jacob Jankowski.  Normally, I'd much rather do my own reading, however David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones did an excellent job; the ninety-something-year-old Jacob was especially enjoyable.  When he read, I felt as if I were sitting next to him in the nursing home listening to his amazing story.

Wow!  I picked this up to read on the airplane to & from Las Vegas.  I wound up finishing it while on my trip.Gruen is a wonderful story teller, you can tell she researched extensively for this novel.  While it's not a book really about a circus, that is the main setting for most of the book.  I really thought it would be a book all about Carnie Folk.  How far from the truth was I?!The story is told from the view of an ageing circus vet, which is different to begin with.  One would think that these types of stories would be told from performer's points of view & while that would be interesting, Jacob's POV is just as intriguing as another other's would have been.It's a great short read that's captivating & spellbinding.

First I must mention that I love books that take you to a time and place that you have no knowledge about and in this case it's circus life in the first half of the 1900's. It was fascinating to read what life was like in those days for those who worked in the circus, from performers to the labors. As for the book itself I did enjoy it, but I wouldn't call it a page turner and often in the first quarter of the book I thought about just putting the book down and starting something else a little more exciting to read. However the farther into the book I got the more I started to care about the characters the more invested in the book I became. In the end I was very glad I continued to read the book and now I can say I would recommend the book to friends.

I can't say I have ever read a book that was even remotely similar in plot or storyline. Water for Elephants is one of the most original novels that has ever graced my eyes. I felt all the emotions Jacob did as I read, and the story seemed to transition seamlessly between the present, and his memories without being confusing as some other books can be when they try the memory flashback thing. It's one of the few books that I read that I simply could not put down, stopping only to eat and sleep.

This is a very beautiful, well-written story that at times had you really feeling - both good and bad feelings - for many of the characters. Jacob lived a hard life after his parents died but I appreciated his tenacity. He was determined to make it in the circus and to make it in life. I throughly enjoyed the ending and I think if I was Jacob that that's how I'd want to spend the rest of my days too. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a story about real life, struggles, love, loss, and hope.

...so all I can do is add my voice to chorus.Gruen writes an incredible dual-novel.  The tale of one man, both fresh out of college and fresh into a nursing home.  The character development is impeccable, with every player on the stage being exposed to the reader to the precise level needed for their role.  As for the plot...this is such a fresh story, I had no idea where it might be going.  This was the first book in a long time I hadn't figured out ahead of time.If you enjoy fiction, read this book.  Possibly the best written novel I've read in years.

This unique story brings back a slice of the 1930s, the long gone circus world of the past, but not the usual bigtop action.  The main character is without giving away anything serves in a position that straddles the worlds of performer and worker and yet belongs to neither. There's madness, grinding poverty, tradgedy, revengeexcitement, bewilderment, surprises, and revelations, but I don't believe a review should be a book report, so trust me if you like suspense, tinged with the meaning of life itself, please do yourself the favor of reading this wonderful novel.  I wish I could erase my memories and do so afresh.  Jim.

This novel made me want to meet someone who had worked on a circus before.  The prologue is all I read in the store and I immediately felt the need to buy it because of the mystery.  The book is filled with exciting storylines that will capture your attention and keep it there throughout the story--hoping that the storyline will end as you hoped.When you get to the part in the book that the prologue mentions, the actual outcome will surprise you. The animals all find a way into your heart and the characters are all worth remembering and holding on to.  I recomend this book for anyone interested in historical fiction or even science fiction because while it revolves around reality, a cirus, the way that it is written almost feels like science fiction.

I don't read fiction.  A snob journalist, I believe my time is better spent reading non-fiction. Due to reasons I won't bore you with, I picked this book up and thumbed through the first couple of pages, just to see if the writing was any good. I didn't put it down. Read it through to the finish. (The last time this happened with me and fiction was fifteen years ago with "Boy's Life" by Robert McCammon.)Sara is a wonderful storyteller with an engaging narrative style, and Jacob is a colorful character with whom to build a story around.So, if you're a non-fiction snob like me or a fiction addict like my wife, you can't go wrong with this book. Highly recommended.

I do not think the idea was so original.ie boy meets girl, ect. but the research that the author put into the circus idea was just great. I actually felt like I learned something about a life I would never had even thought to learn anything about. I would definatley look for more titles from this author because her research and time put into her characters and themes is fantastic.

The perspective from a 90 or 93 year old (he can't remember which) man in a wheelchair in a nursing home, with flashbacks of his life on a circus train during the Depression all provided an interesting, thought-provoking story.  In addition, the conversation with the author and the study questions at the end of the book are a nice bonus.

I had high hopes for this book.  Lots of great reviews, an interesting setting I find fascinating, and a love story--not too shabby.  I didn't go in expecting literary greatness, but even so this book fell flat.  For starters, the "old man reflecting from a retirement home" is a tired technique and all those chapters bored me to tears. My main problem with the novel, however, is that the characters are one dimensional.  They always seem to be doing dramatic things and facing tragedy after tragedy, but I couldn't connect because there is very little reflection or internal monologue (not even in the retirement home!).  The story clips along at such a quick pace it gets bogged down by its own far-fetched events.  I found it difficult to understand why the characters, and even Rosie the elephant, act the way they do--everything seems trumped up to make the plot work. I can't say I even completely understand the title.  I got the connection to the man in the retirement home who claimed he carried water for elephants, but what in the heck did this have to do with the story?  Maybe I'm just not deep enough to understand!  Quite frankly, I didn't enjoy the book much at all and my advice would be to skip it.  Perhaps the movie is better.

I was extremely happy with every aspect of this book until, in one of the final chapters, when Uncle Al tells Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic, or as he puts it, a "paragon schizophonic".  After reading this, there seemed to me to be simply too many similarities with an older novel I read in 2006, William Styron's modern classic SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  A beautiful Catholic woman and a handsome Jewish man who fight a lot due to the man's schizophrenia, another younger man who is new to their 'group' who has feelings for the woman...sex...death...the only dfference seems to be the circus setting and the fact that in this, the woman DOESN'T die and ends up married to the new, younger man.  A nice book, but not extremely original, at least not in the romantic storyline.

This is my new favorite book. Besides being a GREAT story, I feel like I have made many new and interesting friends.  Sara Gruen demonstrates a gift for characterization.  Each character transcends his/her strengths and weaknesses to portray the good, the bad and the ugly of circus life in the post-depression era.  She truly captured the mystique of "running away to join the circus" through her characterization.Jacob Jankowski's (the narrator & featured characher) sense of humor is priceless.  I found myself either chuckling out loud or squirming in disgust throughout his storytelling.I found the book difficult to put down; yet, I did not want it to end.If you don't read another book this summer, read this one.  You will experience a myriad of emotions--happiness, sadness, fury, longing, relief, distress, even enchantment. . .

The story is different and engrossing, showing a subculture rarely seen.  I didn't expect to like a book about the circus, but found it fascinating.

What took me so long to discover this book?  I hadn't heard about it from anyone, just found it during a "browse."  I've been looking for a good read for so long and "Water for Elephants" was right there the whole time.  I can't wait to read Sara Gruen's other books and when I finish them, her new one should be available.  She brings to life the good, the bad and the ugly of the circus world and her characters are vivid and full of life.  I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and falling in love with the main animals.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page...and the end was worth the whole trip.  For me it was one of those books that I was sorry to finish.  Thank you, Sara Gruen, for the beautiful journey.

First of all, Sara Gruen tells a really good story. People and animals both have their moments. What most impresses me though is her ability to show the feelings and memories of an old man. Once old, we tend to forget that the old man in a nursing home was once a part of exciting and dangerous events.To me, the viewpoint and dialogue of Joseph at 90 (or 93) really makes this book.Give it a read.And now the point of the Audio review:  If you like the book then you will find the unabridged audio a real treat. The reader captures the characters and takes you right along. We have listened to the story twice and still appreciate the skill of the reader and the beauty of this book.

I started reading "Water for Elephants" on a Saturday night and before I knew it, I had read half the book in one sitting. Sara Gruen's protagonist Jacob Jankowski, carries you through the novel - both as a twenty-three year old who just walked out of his Vet exams and onto the Circus arena and as ninety-three year old man stuck in a nursing home. Gruen's flawless ability to capture Jacob's voice both as a young and old man are is one of the many strengths of her talents. The storyline, which is composed of coming-of-age, love and well a circus will draw you in and keep you till you eyes read over every last word. "Water for Elephants" is a brilliantly, well-written and engrossing story that will appease to both men and women alike.

I loved this book! I found it very easy to read and get lost in the story. I liked how it was told from present-day Jacob's view looking back on his life. This helped me understand what type of man he was. I felt like I was there will him throughout this story. The setting of the Great Depression made the struggles and triumphs mean so much more. I found all the main characters; Jacob, August, Marlena, Walter, and even the elephant, Rosie, to be extremely poignant, especially when you remember the story is told from an elderly Jacob. The transitions from "memories" to "current day" Jacob were very smooth and I didn't feel distracted or lost during these changes. If you love a romance novel with hero and heroine, then you must read this book!

1) I hate the circus because I don't believe in subjecting animals to this kind of treatment.2) I loved this book so much it is now one of my favorites because:3) After reading this book, it's made me understand so much more about the inner workings of the circus and that for every villain associated with mishandling animals, there is a hero or two protecting and nurturing these creatures.I applaud the author, who is a horse breeder/activist from what I gather, for writing about the circus. I thought it was going to be some horrible account of the circus life and have no substance. Boy was I wrong. The protagonist Jacob leaves his exams to become a vet after learning of the death of his parents and literally jumps aboard a train not knowing what kind of train it is or the kind of people on it. I guess you have to just take the biggest risks in life sometimes and do what does not make sense to reap the biggest rewards.I am anxiously awaiting the movie to come out in April! I hope they don't butcher it.

When I downloaded this book, I honestly didn't expect much more than a nice way to pass some time.  I really underestimate this little gem.  Once I picked it up I found it hard to put down.  In fact, I stayed up past my bedtime to finish it, but it was worth the extra cup of coffee I had to have the next morning.Without going into any details about the story itself (there's more than enough other reveiws to do that), I'll start by saying I was almost immediately endeared with the main charachters, which is a testament to the writing abilities of the author.  I laughed and cried with the characters, and was genuinely sad to see some of them go.While the ending was more than a little predictable, it was still a good read.

What can I say, this book moved me. I saw the movie and put off reading the book, the movie wasn't bad but didn't inspire me to start reading.  Wow, am I glad I did! The transitions from depression time to the present left me breathless. The expertly told story played with all my emotions.  Left me with a renewed appreciation for the difficult times my parents and grandparents grew up in, yet made me want to experience them.  I couldn't put the book down until finished then I went to my computer, looked up old circus pictures and finally bought tickets to Ringling Brothers Circus later this summer.

I used to love to read, however it has been ages since a book has captured me like this one did. The description of characters is both dear and terrible at times.  The description of the life with the circus in this time in history is fascinating. Not really for young readers, it is a bit lusty in some areas but not offensive to me. I have not experienced the movie yet, it will be a challenge to capture the quality of this  book.  I look forward to reading more of Sara Gruen novels.

I agree with many of this book's reviews.  They're right; the author does make you empathize with her characters.  When reading, I felt like I was right with the characters, watching them.  Many reviewers also emphasize and appreciate the book's unusual story.  The story really does have wonderful historical flavor.  Most of the characters participate in a 1930s traveling circus, and reading about this circus-society is entertaining and informative.Now, for all of that, the book's writing was nothing extraordinary.  While Sara Gruen tells a unique story, she is not a unique storyteller.  Her writing was too common for me, too similar to the writing styles of so many authors who are currently alive.As I was reading, I kept asking myself, "Have I read anything by this author before?"  The truth was, I had never read anything else by her.  But I felt like I had, because her writing style and word choices were nothing new to me.I imagine that, in a couple years, I won't be able to remember reading this book.  Perhaps I'll hear someone talk about it, and I'll get a feeling of deja-vu and say, "Oh yeah.  I think I might have read something like that, at some point."Again, don't get me wrong; this was an engaging book.  It was entertaining, and I cared about the characters.  It was a good read, and well worth my time.  I happily recommend it to people who want to be entertained, and who might like to read about the circus.  Just don't expect anything amazing.Oh, and if you don't like violence or scenes with sexual content, you should probably stay away.  I don't mind these things - this doesn't affect my rating - but I figured a warning was warranted.

I passed over this book many times but one day decided to take a chance. I was not expecting such a great read. Read the entire book in a day and was left wanting more. Such as, did they ever find Walter's and Camel's body after the train stopped? Did they ever capture or prosecute Blackie and his gang for murder? Wish I knew more. Maybe there will be a second book later. Meantime, for those of you not steeped in elitist review criticism, this book is a wonderful surprise.

Jacob Jankowski loses everything dear to him; he goes a little nuts and joins the circus. Gruen writes an engaging story that kept me turning the pages. She knows how to build suspense; she uses foreshadowing in the first few pages that makes the reader want to get to that point in the story. Although this may sound commercial, it's a complement: this novel was made to be turned into a movie, and I believe it is going to be one. Join the circus and fall in love!

I was so excited about this book. Something about it really made me want to love it. I bought the hardcover, which is something I never do, because I didn't want to wait for the paperback edition. I should have saved my money.The story was interesting enough and it certainly kept me engaged for the entirety of the novel. I would have liked the detail to be more fleshed out. Some parts seemed to be rushed (like the ending) while others were oddly long. I also think it was easy to tell that it was a woman attempting to write from a male perspective and while sometimes that works out fine this time something seemed a bit off.Still the book was fine and everything came full circle. The ending was neat and tidy, but really not a bit realistic. If you are looking for a quick read this would fit the bill, but it's not a book I'm keeping around and I certainly wouldn't read it again.

The story follows Jacob Jankowski, who is living out the rest of his life in a rest home.  When he was 23, he was poised to become a veterinarian.  However, fate stepped in and he left school.  He ended up joining a traveling circus, where he assisted with the menagerie.  During this time, he falls in love with Marlena, who is a performer in the show and also married to the ringleader.I will say that Gruen is gifted in her ability to create imagery.  You can see the animals and feel the angst that the circus employees go through under their sadistic leaders.  That being said, I can't say that Marlena is a well-developed character.  I don't feel as though we know why Jacob fell in love with her, beyond the fact that she was beautiful and cared about her animals.  It feels as though that part of the story was left out.And why is August, Marlena's husband, so evil? It does sound as though he suffers from some mental issues, but what is the background on him?I just couldn't fall in love with these characters nor the story.

Thankfully I read this for free from the Kindle Prime lending library - I would not have wanted to actually spend money on this book.The beginning of the story with the older Jacob reminiscing was initially interesting but from there on, the story went downhill for me.For one thing, I couldn't shake off a distinct impression of deja vu as I read this book. Then it struck me that I was strongly remindedof Stephen King's "The Green Mile" when I read the old Jacob sections (very old man in an old person's home reminiscing about anoddly sentient animal while struggling to retain his identity in the face of unsympathetic caregivers). There's even the Popeye/Olive Oyl8-pager which is also referenced in "The Green Mile".  The Jacob/Marlena/August triangle was similar to the onein William Styron's "Sophie's Choice" (volatile charming Jewish man with a personality  disorder married to a younger sensitive woman, theyoung man taken under the older man's wing falling in love with the wife, resulting in violence and upheaval).But beyond that, the Jacob/Marlena love story was very poorly developed. Marlena never came together as a three-dimensionalcharacter.  When older Jacob talks about his wife and how she was his helpmeet at the beginning of the book, a weak, passive character such as Marlena was not the woman I pictured. I certainly don't understand why he fell so deeply in love with her. The ending was feel-good but nevertheless unsatisfying due to its lack of realism.The few plus points in this book are the quirky secondary characters such as Walter and Camel. The thematic setting of a traveling circus was also interesting but after reading the author interview included with the Kindle version, it seems a lot of the side plots and atmospheric color were lifted largely unaltered from actual instances the author read or heard about while researching the book.Given the hype, I didn't expect a book that I will barely remember in another month except for its similarity to other, better works.

One of the most entertaining piece fiction I've read in the past 12 months. During post-depression era, the protagonist, Jacob, is left penniless after his parents' sudden death. Completely aimless, he jumps the first train he sees and literally lands in a circus train, plunging him head-first into a fascinating world filled with performers of all shapes and talents, a miserly ring-master, a beautiful horse trainer and a liquor-drinking/Polish-tongued elephant named Rosie.Sara Gruen does an incredible job of incorporating history and urban legends: paralysis that afflicted thousands from drinking "Jake", an alcohol substitute concocted during The Prohibition; the humongous dead hippo that was preserved in formaldehyde to fool thousands of viewers (pickled elephant).I highly recommend this book; just sit back and let yourself get lost in this strange and fascinating story.

This was a tremendously fun and interesting read... not to mention educational too. The whole travelling circus/sideshow thing has always fascinated me, so it was interesting to find a novel with that as it's backdrop. The characters felt very real and I found myself reading far past my bedtime because I wanted to see what was going to happen next.The only dissapointing part of the book to me was at the very end. I can see how some people like things to be tied up in a nice little bow, but to me it was so implausable that it almost ruined the whole reading experience.

This is not just a good summer read. It's a good (no, make that excellent) all-season read. I won't go into the plot because other reviewers have done it, and done it well. Suffice it to say, this book had me in its clutches from beginning to end, and the story has stayed with me ever since that last page was turned. In addition to Rosie (the most endearing elephant this side of Horton and Dumbo), Gruen's circus characters grab hold of you and refuse to let go. I was particularly enamored of Kinko/Walter and the way his relationship with Jacob developed over the course of this compelling story.The writing is rich and fulfilling, full of texture. This novel will engage all your senses. You will see the big top and hear the guys pounding in the stakes. You will smell the animals, the aroma of fresh sawdust and breakfast cooking. And you will feel the same pleasure and pain the characters feel as they take your hand and lead you into the world of a Depression era circus.As for how Gruen, a young woman, managed to get herself into the head of a 93-year-old man? Well, isn't that what superbly talented authors do? Transport you to places you never thought you'd ever go?I'll be looking forward, eagerly, to her next novel.

Jacob Jankowski is an old man now - either 90 or 93 years old - but his youthful memories of life as a veterinarian with the Benzini Bros Most Spectacular Show on Earth remain vivid, especially when a traveling circus camps just outside the grounds of his assisted living care facility. All those he cared about during his circus days: Marlena the bare-back rider, Rosie the elephant, Camel the roustabout, Walter the dwarf and Bobo the orangutan are dead now, but they glow with life in Jacob's memory.  It's true his memories are not always pleasant. His years with the circus were depression years for the country, with circuses failing on all sides. If you read this book you'll see a side of the circus you probably never imagined: its rigid caste system of performers vs working men, skipped paychecks, long days and longer nights, jealousy, madness and death. But you'll also find beauty, love and great kindness, especially to some remarkable animals.Oh, and the ending is quite wonderful if perhaps a bit fanciful. A grand book about the big top. Don't miss it.

I have to agree with a lot of the mediocre and low star reviews. As many have said, it is a very interesting subject, but it could have been done much better.  I'll preface this by saying that I hardly ever read contemporary fiction, so perhaps I'm just not used to the modern style of writing.  Most fiction I read is from the era when a book could not be published if there was too much "obscenity" or if it was too graphic.Nonetheless, here's where I felt this novel fell short:As others have noted, it felt too contemporary.  Some of the language didn't seem to fit the times. I know the "f" word and other swearing has been around forever, but I almost never hear people from that generation use it. Also, young Jake laments being a virgin so much, but from talking with people who came of age before the sexual revolution, it was pretty much expected that one would remain that way until marriage. Even Hugh Hefner was a virgin until his mid 20s.The character of Jake was not convincing. I didn't get a good sense of who he really was as a young man, and the young Jake and the old Jake could have been two different people as far as I could tell.I didn't find the old Jake to be very symphathetic.  I felt bad for him for being trapped in a nursing home, but he gave the nurses a hard time and picked fights with another male resident which canceled out a lot of sympathy I would have had for him.  Also, I had trouble with Jake's situation.  If he couldn't even remember his family members who came to visit or the names of the nurses who took care of him, how come he could always remember the names and details of his fellow residents with no problem?A lot of reviewers had trouble reading the scenes about animal cruelty. I love animals, but I didn't have that much trouble reading them because I wasn't really convinced by the writing.As many others have said, the ending is unrealistic. Some people may not be bothered by this, but that's one thing that irks me.On the positive side, it was entertaining. It captured my interest and I was curious to see how it ended.

Jacob Jankowski is 93 years old.  He is as sharp as a tack and somewhat cantankerous, as many of us will probably be if we live so long.  At 93 he resides in a nursing home, not his choice, but probably for the best.  Now the circus has come to town and set-up within view of the home causing great excitement.Jacob was a member of the traveling Benzini Brothers Circus during the Great Depression and his memories of those days are still clear.  Water for Elephants tells the story of how Jacob lost everything while finishing his final year at Cornell Veterinary School and joined the traveling circus.Gruen tells the story in two parts, going back and forth from the past to the present time in a way that is easy to read and very entertaining.  Her extensive research into traveling circuses and elephants makes this a very good readThis is one of those books that once you start reading it, you won't want to put it down.  It has been on the NY Times Best Seller List for 76 weeks as of today and it is still ranks in Amazon's Top 100 after nearly two years since its publication.

This is an immersive, addictive, intricately researched novel that transports the reader to dusty, hardscrabble depression-era US. Young Jacob Jankowski flees his veterinarian final exams at Cornell when he learns of his parents' accidental death. Faced with sudden poverty when the bank takes his parents' possessions, he starts walking with no destination in mind, and jumps a circus train in the middle of the night. The inner world of the circus unfolds around him as he learns of the class divide between the workers and performers, the fragility of the circus' desperate illusions, and the economic vulnerability of everyone on the show. He becomes the show's vet and befriends monkeys, tigers, horses, and one oppressed but ultimately triumphant elephant.Sara Gruen is a master of plot, building to a suspenseful climax and weaving together her storylines with tidbits and gems from her research on American circuses. She respectfully explores her characters' strengths and weaknesses, ultimately delivering an honest and intricate portrait of a difficult time in US history. This book was a 100% satisfying read.

Sara Gruen has penned a most enjoyable book about life in the circus.  The story unfolds in two time frames from the first-person point of view of Jacob Jankowski.  As a twenty-three year old vet traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth and as a ninety-three year old man confined to an assisted living facility and repulsed by the sight of his aging body, his ever-sharp mind moves us effortlessly between the two time periods.  We are told he is about to reveal a secret he has kept hidden for seventy years----and what a story it is!In 1931, a tragic accident takes his parents from him and leaves him alone and penniless in the midst of the Great Depression.  The circus is both his salvation and his personal hell as he signs on to care for the animals.  Jacob and the characters he encounters are drawn so vividly that you will remember them long after the last page is read:  Marlena, the pink-sequined star of the equestrian act; her mercurial husband August who suffers with bouts of paranoid schizophrenia; Walter, the dwarf whose mother sold him to the circus, and Camel, the first member of the circus to befriend Jacob will all make you laugh and cry and cry again.  But it is Rosie, the lemonade-stealing elephant, who will steal a piece of your heart and cause you never to look at elephants in quite the same way again.Heartbreaking, poignant, and with a double surprise of an ending, this amazing plot unfolds with actual circus stories the author tells us in her end note that she has taken from real life.  Peppered with antique photos of long-ago circuses, this is an amazing book not only of circus life but of a man coming to grips with his diminished capacity and the aging flesh surrounding his ever-young heart.  A true joy for this reader, and one I highly recommend.

Others have reviewed the store line much more in depth and better than I can here. I loved this book. Once I started reading it, I didn't put it down. This is not a silly little beach read as it has been touted. It is more in depth than that.The characters were believable. They didn't do anything that was totally out of character once their basic personality was developed. The setting was realistic and interesting and a vital part of the story. The ending was surprising.Very well written. Very interesting. Worth the time to read and worth the money.Enjoy.

I enjoyed reading Water For Elephants very much. There is excitement, love, sadness, and fills you full of empathy while reading. You begin to feel as though you are a worker on the carnival train going from town to town following the drama and excitement. One of the best books I have read.

Water for Elephants is truly an excellent read. The story is narrated by Jacob Jankowski, well the 93 year old version and the 23 year old version. The young Jankowski joined a traveling circus in depression-era America after the sudden death of his parents. With his veterinary background, Jacob is put in charge of the filthy, underfed and sometimes abused animals. The Benzini Bros. traveling circus is everything one would imagine a circus to be-dirty, crazy, and full of all kinds of different folks. Workers are apt to disappear in the night (thrown from the train, no longer able to be paid). It is obvious that Gruen did her homework on traveling circuses. Her terminology is spot-on and her vivid description is exquisite. The stand out characters are August the animal trainer, Marlena (his wife and a performer in the circus), and of course Rosie, the elephant. Gruen weaves together a story that is at times hilarious, heartwrenching, touching, warm, sad and so moving. The ending is perfect, and I could not have asked for a more enjoyable read.

Maybe I'm missing the bandwagon (no pun intended), but all these reviews that say "amazing", "best book I've ever read", etc.??  I don't get that.  I was drawn to the story and the characters, and it was well-written.  It was an easy read, so I finished it in a day and a half.  However, I don't consider it anything more than a fun read--something good for the beach or the plane. I'm defintely not seeing the hype.

An interesting way to showcase circus history & a way of life that is no more.Although this is a fictionalized account, it was based on bits & pieces of fact from Circus History.The photographs were the best.They were a nice addition to the book.The nursing home drama/tie-in was a bit too much.I guess it was a play on the theme of running away to join the circus...Just never heard of someone who ran away from a nursing home in a wheel chair to join the circus & was successful with it!

Water for Elephants presents a story of a veterinarian's life told from both his present and earlier life perspective.  The way that the author switched between time periods was entertaining.  I found myself experiencing a wide range of emotions from horror to curiosity to anger and then to happiness.  I personally have never been to a circus so I don't have any memories of my own to go by.  However, the author's descriptions of the circus atmosphere and "class" system within the different groups makes it very easy to imagine just how life was living on that train traveling from town to town.  I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to the film version.

Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is one of those rare novels that will be read and re-read, discussed and enjoyed for many years, by old and young alike. Destined to be passed among family and friends and back again, until the tattered, timeworn pages resemble the books beloved central character and narrator.Jacob Jankowski had studied Veterinary Medicine and was days from exams when his parents were killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, he hopped a train, never intending to "run away with the circus".... It was the midst of the depression and life was hard. Joining the Benzini Brothers Circus would change his life again. From town to town, day after day, set it up, tear it down-the freaks and geeks, midgets and clowns worked, ate, lived and often died together. The harsh conditions are made even more unbearable by the greedy manager and his insane animal trainer. Yet somehow, in the midst of despair, friendships and laughter persevered. Although much of the laughter was alcohol induced, during the height of the depression and prohibition, you took what you could get.The narrator's transition from the young circus vet, to the elderly, cantankerous nursing home resident, is a well-crafted, bi-lateral view that pulls the reader into this fictional world and never lets go. Whether in his twenties, admiring the beautiful equestrian performer, Marlena, and caring for the animals he loved-or in his nineties, complaining about the indignities of old age, the warm, quick wit comes through loud and clear. From the big top to the nursing facility Gruen's sharp, three-dimensional, fictionally fluid characters will have you laughing out loud one minute, mouth agape in disgust the next.Hurry, hurry, step right up, readers and book lovers everywhere. If you hunger for a reading experience chock full of every conceivable emotion, beautifully written and wholly engrossing, Water for Elephants is a wondrous world, where fact and fiction combine, delivering the most memorable and pleasurable hours, you will be spend with a book. Characters so sharply drawn and wrought with emotion that there nearly flow off the page.Armchair Interviews says: If you only read one book this summer, let this be it!

I enjoyed this book but did not feel it quite lived up to the high ratings I based my purchase on. Part of its appeal was the promise of a circus story. And the story was very realistic in some ways, detailing how difficult and unrewarding (not to mention very dangerous)that life could be.Some of the most interesting and moving parts of the book were actually those that took place in the nursing home that Jacob now lives in, remembering his youth with the circus. The author did a great job in describing the sadness, loneliness and other problems that befall the very aged. Especially those nearly forgotten by their families. Their cold treatment at the hands of people who barely see these elderly souls as human is all too real, having witnessed this myself when working in this type of facility. And another reason why I got out of nursing.The love story was so-so, and years were wrapped up too quickly, at least for my taste. I looked forward to more stories of Jacob as the circus veterinarian. There was alot of potential there for interesting and moving stories about the animals, but that aspect was barely touched upon. Rather it was more about Jacob's obsession with the beautiful Marlena.I loved many of the interesting characters, but always felt I did not quite know them in spite of their frequent appearances throughout the story. Walter the dwarf as an example. He was one of my favorite characters. I found myself wanting more of his own story, but it wasn't there.I would recommend this as a light summer read, but would not look for more than an interesting diversion and brief look into the world of the circus folk when the animals were still transported by train and when the circus coming to town was the biggest news of the month.

The story was thoughtful and well-written.  The present-day Jacob was actually more compelling and believable than the Jacob of the main, remembered story.If you liked the circus world information, and have a high tolerance for some graphic content, read Gary Jennings' "Spangle" (which has been split into three separate books for paper back), a rich, detailed story of a circus in post-Civil War America and Europe.Spangle

It was mentioned in the public radio and on the New York Times list--- means should be readable. I guess, for regular folks who only dream of running away and joining the circus, it was entertaining and everything but was annoyng when narrative style sort of goes back and forth in between Frank McCourt to James Frey.( I am. I do. I think. I feel. I, I, I.... )I don't know, I am less than half of Jacob's age but have been lived and worked in the circus, I just couldn't feel or smell sawdust in it at all. I couldn't see any character's face clearly. As author notes in the end, it is a patchwork of cut and pasted information from her research. I wish the author did bother to travel with the show, any show, awhile. Then she would have understand that big top and cookhouse ready to serve hot meals won't go up in length of just 5 paragraphs even with all the machineries of millennia, let alone of 1930s.There should be generations of elephants handlers to be found in Sarasota and their stories are worth listening to than museum facts, that is if you can get in to their doorsteps and able to decode their language.I understand this book is a fantasy. If you want to smell sawdust, try based on true historic circus figures "The Final Confession of Mabel Stark" " Modoc: The True Story of the Greatest Elephant Ever Lived" or watch "Dumbo" in retro circus.In the category of fiction, even though it caused lot of pain to people all the characters are based too obviously, I'd give "Roustabout" some credit because its author was actually there, though not on the tent crew as the heroine.Congratulations anyway, how about donating profit and future movie deal $ to circus vet. funds( for humans and animals) ?

In a time of difficulties and in a place where exotic things are a rule, Sara Gruen sets her novel "Water for elephants". The story starts with moment of violence and from then on is tolerable narrative mess. The main character is a veterinarian student who drops school, joins a circus during the Depression-era, finds love, hate and whatever may crosses his way.The lessons he learns are so valuable that decades later, living in a home for old people, he can still perfectly recall them - and pass them along. He is Jacob, a strange figure, who is no longer an alien when he runs into people even stranger than him. Tod Browning's movie "Freaks" comes to mind, but Gruen never reaches the same level.The only redeeming point in the book are the old black and white circuses pictures with scenes from a bygone era. On the other hand, Gruen's heavy-handed prose lacks the sparkling that would enhance "Water for elephants". Her storytelling abilities are more focused in the tell - when it should be the showing - missing the chance of creating a whimsical story. We learn every step Jacob takes from a to c, even the unnecessary b. With card-board flat characters, the aninals end up stealing the show. These excesses tone down the narrative and keep the novel from reaching a higher artistic level.

This book was very moving for me.  The way Gruen writes about the older character seemed so very well done.  Even though I am not old, I felt older reading those passages.  Gruen moves back and forth from present day to the past very smoothly and it is always a seamless transition for the reader.  Great story, good characters, loved Rosie the elephant. Very thought provoking and I really adored the old carny photographs sprinkled throughout the book.  Never thought I would enjoy a depression era book, but this one was really well done.

The inner workings, relationships, conflicts of circus life are so well described in this novel with such interesting detail, you really feel like you are there.

As a child in Memphis, Tn., the  most exciting time in my childhood life was when the days the circus came to town. My father loaded me, my two brothers and my sister into the car and off we went to the Clyde Beatty circus under the big top. Water for Elephants brought these memories back as though they were yesterday. I read the book over a 3 day period and really enjoyed it. It's a terrific story that I would recommend to all my friends.

WATER FOR ELEPHANTS by Sara GruenThis is a marvelous book that covers the two bookends of the long adventurous life of Jacob Jankowski, going back and forth from him as a ninety-plus-year old in an assisted living facility, to him thinking back to his days working on the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus that moved around the country in its own train.He is all alone in the nursing home, with most the employees viewing him as more trouble than he is worth, except for one wonderful nurse named Rosemary, who shows him respect and compassion, and is for all practical purposes his only friend at this point in his life. While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book. I will not spoil it for you, but you are certain to like and appreciate it.This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.Hey Joe (Jamaica Series)

Sure "Water for Elephants" has been around and even turned into a movie, but I've only just now read the book.  I'll have to go and see the movie . . . if only to see the director's interpretation of the glorious scenes of circus life this book conjures up in the reader's mind.Judging by the number of people who took time out to write reviews for this book, I must say it lives up to the critical acclaim in just about every way possible.  At least for this reader it did. Every writer knows that in order to keep the readers' attention a novel must have tension on every page.  This novel is almost the illustration of that rule.  I loved taking the trip.  I highly recommend this book to almost anyone.  I think it will become a classic.This is masterful writing and I've passed it on to my sister who is now devouring it whole.  Congratulations to Sara Gruen for producing this stunning page-turner.  I absolutely loved it!5 Stars.  Great Read!

I enjoyed this book a lot, despite the fact that some of the stuff said doesn't match the era in which it was written. I wasn't as bothered by the small issues as some of the other reviewers were, apparently. It is a work of fiction after all. Sure, there were quite a few cliches, but not to the point of distraction. I liked the animals and their personalities, namely Rosie, the star of the show. She stole my heart and when she was a victim of violence, my heart broke for her.Having the old man relive his memories of the circus was very compelling and tied the story of then and now together nicely. The ending made me cry, but not why you'd expect.

With all the "hype" about this book, I was expecting more-more plot,and a more interesting main character. And really it reads like a script. So often the author does too much explaining about how each character is sitting, their reaction,etc. as if in preparation for a movie,with too much explaining how the actors should perform.I do like the depression era and the circus theme , which drew me to the book.I am looking forward to seeing the movie but mostly because of the actors in it.All in all I didnt care for the authors way of writing. But I think it will make for an interesting movie.

I loved this book and didn't expect to because I've never been a fan of the circus. The novel seamlessly alternates between two periods of Jacob's life, beginning when he was in his early 20s, having lost everything after the death of his parents (the impetus for his joining the circus) and as an elderly man in a nursing home.I was especially moved by the author's clear respect for older people through her portrayal of Jacob and the other residents of the nursing home. The conversations between Rosemary and Jacob were deeply touching and I loved the way Rosemary gently explained to Jacob why the man might have lied about carrying water for elephants at the circus. Oh, and the ending was just beautiful. I was rooting for Jacob all the way!I was also fascinated by some of the historical bits such as redlighting and Jake Leg, a disease some people got (usually poor people) from drinking Jamaican Ginger Extract during the Prohibition Era. And I can't forget Rosie, the amazing elephant and where she spent her final years - This was a book I could not put down!  I guess the only

This book was suggested to me by a friend and I wasn't sure I would like it. As soon as I started reading I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I read it in about a week.  This particular book earned it's place on the New York Bestsellers list for a reason.An elderly man, looking back on the past and how it has shaped him now.  The book is set in the present day as well as the early 1930's.  It paints the picture of exactly what I would think a traveling circus would be during that time.  It is full of drama within in the reigns of the circus as far as the everyday workers, performers, and animals. From cover to cover the reader does not know exactly what to expect.  I would suggest this book to anyone.One of the best books I have read in some time.  I can't wait to see the movie!

I normally don't select bestsellers for reading pleasure; they so often disappoint. Had my book club not selected this for discussion I probably would not have read it. But I am so glad I did. The book is well writen, not just a good story, but excellent writer's craft. Any person over fifty with any empathy at all will identify with the story teller. Younger people will identify with the main characters in the circus story. I am not particularly interested in circus history, but this was fascinating. The ending is especially wonderful...fanciful but wonderful.

It took me a bit to get into this book. I'm not sure why - but mostly it is probably because my days have started out so busy, I don't get around to reading til I'm already exhausted. Once I got into it, I couldn't stop reading. I stayed up too late, I read until I fell asleep, and then got irritated when I woke up and didn't have time to finish the book. :) It really only took a few hours, it was just finding those few hours to read.Great summer read, beautiful love story, and definitely makes me want to FINALLY see a circus. Yes, I'm 35 and have not been to a circus (that I remember)!***SPOILER ALERT***Don't read any further if you haven't read the book, or get upset by spoilers. Because this will give a few things away.First, a preface ... I love the line because it reminds me of the kind of person I *want* in my life. Faced with a 10ft thick, 100ft tall wall of obstacles, he KNOWS he's on the losing end, but doesn't give up or freak out.My favorite line in the book, "Dear God. Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of."This line made me giggle out loud, and it brightened my whole day.

I'm not a real fan of fiction, only because fiction does not keep me tuned in to the story line. Often the subject matter rambles on before the story line gets going when  you finally know what you are reading about.Water for Elephants is a well written novel. The title fascinated me to begin with, and excerpts led me to believe this was going to be a good read. I was right!  The story line is never boring, it's uncomplicated, and keeps you tuned in to events as they unravel. So well done. I encourage anyone who is an avid reader to buy a copy. You won't be disappointed.

What a wonderful read!! Once I got into the book I was lost on a train in a circus and I never wanted to leave my new world.  I really enjoyed this book and would reccomend it to everybody that enjoys a good read.  I was also excited that the train went through my towns of Keokuk, Hamilton, and Burlington how exciting!!!!!

This really is an excellent book with an interesting story and well-conceived details.  I listened to the audio version, which was particularly well acted.  My complaint with the book is that it is blatantly anti-Jewish.  The circus leaders, who are described as Jewish, are mean and spiteful, making the lives of the workers a living hell.  Why did Ms. Gruen need to assign a religion to them? I found this really offensive, and played into negative Jewish stereotypes.  My other complaint with the book is that the two Jacobs don't seem like the same person (I'm assuming they are although I'm not quite finished with the book).  One is loving and mild-mannered, the other cantankerous and bitter.  Can these really be the same person?

Water for Elephants is the break-out runaway hit first novel by Sara Gruen.  It's a classic down on his luck boy meets out of his league girl and they fall madly in love story.  Except the story is set in a cruel and gritty circus world of the Depression, which only makes the story more interesting.Gruen's story is well told and written, and she does a good job portraying the everyday cruely of circus life during the hard times of the Great Depression. She creates several interesting and memorable characters--from the scrappy Camel to the manic August.  And several of the circus scenes allow the reader to paint a vivid mental picture, which is always key to a fascinating novel.I'll admit that I was probably the last person in America to read this book, and as a result, I've been hearing about how fantastic it was for three years.  Unfortunately, the book had a hard time living up to these expectations.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn't the great romance/historical novel I was expecting.  I would still recommend that others read it, particularly to compare to the recent movie, since I thought the book had a much stronger storyline.

The setting and writing of this novel give it a wonderful atmosphere. The only thing holding it back is the romance, not that I did not root for the conclusion, but would have enjoyed more of a reason for the couple to be together besides circumstance. That being said, the characters are well built and the world the inhabit fascinating.

A truly fascinating novel - for those of us old enough to remember going to the circus in small towns during the summer and now old enough to share the anxiety and depression of aging it covered the whole gamut.  Only the treatment of both animals and those on the low end of the pay scale could be considered distracting from the good memories.

I'm old enough to remember the traveling circus coming to our small town, and I fear that is going to be a thing of the past----too bad.

This is a book I cannot forget; it stirred me deeply.  Yes, the story telling is brilliant and extremely well written; the parts about the depression and the circus are fascinating; and the ability of a young female author to give voice and depth of character to an old man in his nineties is extraordinary (he is one of literature's most memorable characters!)But for me, there is something which surpasses even all of this.  Gruen touched on and developed a reality with which it is so difficult for most of us to come to grips: that is how the strong, virile, resourceful young man in his twenties continues to reside in the decrepit, rotting body of the stooped, weak old man.  She has drawn so clearly the ungraspable mystery of youth emerging into old age, the spirit of the person masked by the wrinkled cloak of the elderly.  Bravo, Sara.  Well done!

Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story.

This story is now in my top 10 best loved stories.  Now that says something!!!!Jacob Jankowski is a cranky but very likable 93 yr old man who lives in an assisted living center.He is strong willed and has opinions on so many of the other people who live in the centre with him. His body has degenerated and he doesn't want to look in the mirror any more as he does not reconise himself anymore.  He becomes the trouble maker of the group as his mind is sharp  not like his degenerated body.Jacob remembers the circumstances under which he found himself homeless and travelling with the Benzini Brothers Circus. He alternates between the past and his day to day living with his co-workers of the circus going weeks without being paid, and some nights some workers would disappear during the night (the bosses would organise for them to be thrown off a moving train). He sleeps on a horse blanket on the train floor just thankful for a meal and a job.1931 is a hard time during the depression and everyone will do anything just to survive.The world couldn't be any tougher for this young man.This is one of the most moving stories i have ever listened to on Audio cd.A must for everyones collection.

this author is a master story teller and she had me from the first.  The structure of the book is captivating, back and forth from the nursing home where the main character lives out his old age to the fascinating life he has led as a veternarian for the circus and his love affair with the main act.  and that is only the beginning.  It is the story of coming of age in a most unconventional setting.  I learned so much about the inner workings of a circus.  So why oh why did the author end the book on such a maudlin, unrealistic note.  Sarah Gruen forced a happy ending on a story that deserved a more intelligent finale.  Still it is deffinately worth the read.

I just finished reading Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.  It was one of my most favorite reads to date, and I read alot of books!  I loved how the book started in the nursing home with the older Jacob and how he reveiled how it felt to be old and most of the time forgotten.  His family viewed it as a duty to go and visit him..And then it switches to a young Jacob and tells the story of his adventures working in a circus.  For anyone who wanted to run away to the circus as a child, you will definately love this book.  I could not put it down. It is exciting one minute and has you on the edge of your seat and the next it is endearing and makes you feel like you really know the characters.  I give this book 5 stars and if you want a really good read, you will do the same.

After "Riding Lessons", which I loved - and "Flying Changes", which was a huge disappointment to me, I was not sure what I would find in "Water for Elephants".  Wow - what a great read!  Research does pay off hugely - when it enables a writer to place the reader inside another world so easily - the world of the circus. This was a world totally foreign to most of us - but now, so familiar, thanks to Sara.  This book satisfied my three requirements - transportation (take me away from all this),  levitation (lift my spirits and leave me thinking good thoughts) and infiltration (let me get inside the characters so I feel I really know them). Reading "Water for Elephants" is time well-spent.  I'm happy to know Sara is working on a fourth book. I'll be first in line to buy it.

I really loved this story, especially the ending.  I really enjoyed hearing about circus life, which surprised me, I'm not a fan of the circus at all.  I thought Sara Gruen did a great job telling this story but I would have like to have seen a little more character development.  It also had a little extra appeal for me as the story starts out in Ithaca, NY not far from where I grew up and not far from where I live now.

I was a bit hesitant about reading this book, I kept reading that it was about circuses, and I really didn't think I had too much of and interest. Boy was I wrong. It starts with a murder and winds and weaves you through the story of life in the traveling circus and back to present day in a nursing home.  The book had my attention from page one and still has me even though I finished reading it. There is humor, love, murder, and friendship, and a whole lot of history about the circus, and circus life making this book a well rounded engaging read.

"Water for Elephants" by Sara Gruen is an utter delight. I read a library copy for my book club, but after I finished I promptly ordered three copies: for my father, for a favorite aunt, and for my husband. I had to restrain myself from buying more.The book is narrated from the point of view of Jacob Jankowski, a ninety-plus year old man living in a nursing home. He is unhappy with everything about his current situation in life. He constantly flails against the every-present reminders that his body has degenerated so that he hardly recognizes himself. He's become the trouble-making curmudgeon of the facility because his mind is fully alive and has not degenerated along with his body.When a circus comes to town and sets itself up across the street, one of the old coots living in the same home brags that he used to work in the circus carrying "water for elephants." This gets Jacob's ire up. He knows you can't carry water to elephants. They drink too much! The man is lying. Jacob knows the truth because he really did work in the circus. But those memories are long buried. Now that thoughts of this part of his past are awakened, he starts thinking about those halcyon days of his youth--a time when he learned quickly how to become a man.Thus the story of Jacob joining the circus when he was 23, during the heart of the Depression, when he had nothing in the world he could call his own except promise, inner strength, and fortitude. The world couldn't get any tougher for a young man. He learns quickly, and the hard way about many of the most important lessons in life, and he comes away from the experience a remarkably mature, whole, and admirable man.Two-thirds of the book deals with chapters about Jacob as a young man in the circus. One-third deals with Jacob in the nursing home. It is a proper balance and this construction adds to the tension of the story rather than detracts. You care about this man and root for him in both periods of his life.There is a marvelous feel-good ending, full of great humanity. When you finish, you are left with optimism and enthusiasm that sticks with you for a long time. I recommend this book highly. It is a book that can be appreciated by all ages; in fact, I think it would make an enjoyable and thought-provoking young adult title--but for those men and women who actually went through the Great Depression, this book is a treasure. Buy it for every one of those beloved survivors that you have in your immediate circle of friends and family. These people want for nothing material. It is hard to buy presents for them. But this book will be greeted by long-lasting appreciation.

I read a lot of books, and I review very few, but this is a book I really wanted to love and had to force myself to finish.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of "Carter Beats the Devil", but instead I got "The Devil tortures Carter and his girl and Carter ends up alone in a nursing home."  I just couldn't get behind this story.

A couple of years ago a friend gave me a copy of Water For Elephants. I put it aside until a few days ago, at which time I thought I should probably read it. I was hooked from the very beginning and couldn't put the book down. Although, I have never been interested in elephants, I fell in love with Rosie and her sweet personality. Did you know that elephants cry and that they have a huge hippocampus, a brain structure that's important in processing emotions? After finishing the book, I immediately Googled elephants to learn more about these intelligent animals. Water For Elephants has become one of my favorite novels. If you haven't read this one, you are definitely missing a modern classic.

There are more elements than the love story the movie tells. The historical period is described well, the characters are more interesting and Jacob's everyday life is one of the best descriptions of what an old man thinks and feels when he is far from his family.It's an amazing book and even if you're not an english native speaker (as I am) it's an easy read

It took me approximately 8 hours over the course of a week to read this garbage, and in retrospect I can certainly  think of things I would rather have been doing for that 8 hours, like, say, setting my hair on fire or arm-wrestling a 400 lb orangutang.  I reckon those activities would have been more fun and fulfilling.This is a truly bad novel.  Truly bad.  The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional.  I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was.  Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age.  So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise.  Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop.  Probably one of the worst books I've read this decade.  Under no circumstances read this poor excuse for a novel.  The fact that so many reviewers have given it 5-stars is a mystery on par with the Bermuda Triangle. Is it collective hysteria? I just don't get it.

I can definitely see why this book gets five stars from a lot of readers -it has fascinating period detail, an involving (if fantastical) romance, and plenty of action.So to explain my only-four stars, I must confess I "read" the audiobook version - and I was of two minds about it.  Yes, the details about circus life were interesting, and the romance was gripping in a kind of 1930s way.  But there were a lot of things that didn't make sense to me (circuses are going broke right and left, but the star performers appear rich, wearing tuxedos and drinking champagne), and for my money the bad guys were too bad and the good guys too entirely good.  The minor characters (the little person, the hootch dancer, etc.) were more complete than the leads.It would make a heckuva film though - drama, chase scenes on the top of train cars, etc.I also confess that the audio version  may have added to my bad humor - there was one fellow playing the older narrator who was really superb, but the fellow reading the part of the young hero was whiny in the extreme (what did she see in him?.

This is a well-written, cute story.  I certainly achieved the `suspension of disbelief' that one looks for in a summer novel.  I empathized with the main character, and could picture him and the others.  I feel like I know Jacob Jankowski - both the younger version in shock from losing his parents, and the older version who hates being treated like an "invalid".  Unlike some reviewers, I am not old enough to remember the circus coming to town on the train and with a parade.  In fact, the circus experience from my childhood was in a large concert venue.  Nevertheless, Gruen allows me to imagine the big top in all of its grimy glory and picture all of the alcohol loving workers and performers smuggling their drinks on the train.  What a nice escape.

I am so very glad that my mom insisted I read this book.  I typically shy away from stories about the elderly because it is a topic that affects me very deeply and can really be painful to read.  But after I helped care for my 92 year-old grandmother in the week before her death, my mom told me I had to read this and that I'd love it.  She wasn't wrong.The story gripped me immediately with the scene in the menagerie tent.  But I have to say that what I loved the most about this novel was the narrator, Jacob Jankowski.  I fell hard and fast for him from the very first page.  because of this, I purposely read this book slowly so that I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Jacob.  Ms. Gruen did an amazing job not only portraying the life of this man and the interesting friends and enemies he makes while being the vet for a travelling circus, but showing that the elderly have amazing stories to tell.  It showed how dignity is in danger of being lost when elderly people are treated like children once they are of a certain age, but also how so many simple things can bring that dignity back.This book was so wonderful and I found the ending to be uplifting and appropriate and extremely well done.  I wouldn't have accepted any less for this wonderful, amazing character.

This author has captured the essence of what it must feel like to be an old man who is still sharp-as-a-tack and remembers, with vivid detail, a few short months of his long life.  This book is written with clear attention to detail and descriptions of what life very well may have been like with a train circus during Prohibition and the Great Depression.  In addition to the day-to-day goings on there is the added element of several plot lines of a personal nature with feelings of love, loss, joy and sorrow.  Each character is seen from Jacob's point of view and drawn so clearly that you feel you know them personally. I want Jacob to be my friend and so will you!Definitely a book I will be recommending to most everyone!  I only wish there had not been the need for a few relatively explicit scenes as those few make this book unsuitable for my 11-year-old.  She is a voracious reader and wants to be a writer.  She could learn a thing or two about research and character development from this excellent and enjoyable book!

I won't elaborate on the plot as others have taken care of that. Listening to this story is tremendous, as it easily allows for the two voices of Jacob Jenkowski to be clearly heard and distinguished from one another. This book is a love story, a history lesson, a peek into different elements of humanity that have way too much realism. There were times I wanted to skip ahead because I didn't want to hear the unpleasantness taking place in the story. But of course I didn't. Because one has to endure some bad to appreciate the good. The love story is much more too, than a man and a woman - it involves the circus animals and how they instinctively know who is good and who is not. The history lesson reminds us of a lifetime ago, which really isn't so very far away - less than one hundred years, and helps us appreciate how far we have come. The peek into a reality far removed from a life I live reminds me not to take any part of my current life for granted. This is a very rich novel and one that will stick with the reader long after the last page is turned.

I am going to be a bad person right now and say that I do not understand the big hype for this book. I liked it, it was interesting, and I think that carnivals during the Depression are a popular theme in some recent entertainment (Carnivale, The Night Circus), and I can see why.  This book is entertaining but it is not particularly deep or special.  I listened to some of it on audio and that absolutely added to the story.

I truly enjoyed this book.  I loved Jacob as an older man,remembering his youth.  It was very well written and kept my interest from beginning to the end.  I also enjoyed the notes at the end, detailing her research experiences.  I love ELEPHANTS and enjoyed the authors characterzation of Rosie.  The people all had very interesting and different personalities.

Jacob Jankowski is about to take his final veterinary exams at Cornell University when his parents are killed in a road accident. He then discovers that his father has been working as a vet, free of charge, during these early depression years, leaving Jacob penniless and unable to afford to stay at school to finish his exams. He hops a circus train which is going through the town and is hired as the show's vet, virtually unpaid by the avaricious circus owner, and sleeping in a train carriage with horses and the circus "little person". The cast of circus characters, both performers and roustabouts, as the workers are called, provides an interesting back drop to a story of love, manic hatred and cruelty, especially on the part of one of the trainers who has charge of an elephant named Rosie. The story progresses right through Jacob's life until his nineties when, with his frail body but intact memory, he relives his colourful past. It's an entertaining read and the story, the details of which have been thoroughly authenticated by the author, makes a change from anything I've read previously.

Did not like the book.  I especially didn't like the fact that no one could stop the elephant abuse and didn't like the sex in it.  Pretty crude.  Too bad they had to add the graffic sex.  It wasn't necessary to the story!

Jacob Jankowsky is 90...or 93.  He can never remember.  As the book begins, he is a "resident" in an assisted living facility, so I related to it right off, having just spent 2 days with my mother-in-law at an assisted living facility.  As Jacob begins to look backward, we discover that he was "orphaned" as he was getting ready to take his exams for his veterinary license and join his father's practice.  When his parents are killed in an auto accident, he is left with no money and, through an accidental twist of fate, he joins a circus, where he becomes the resident veterinarian.  Over the next four months he learns the good and the bad about circus life, falls in love, discovers the secret of the newly acquired "stupid" elephant, and witnesses the one of the worst circus disasters in history.Gruen is a wonderful writer, with a rich use of language which paints vivid pictures of a world most of us have never experienced.  This is a riveting story with a couple of surprising twists at the end that I didn't see coming.I highly recommend this book.

I don't know why, but when I read a little "blip" somewhere about this book, something told me I would really enjoy it. I mostly read psychological thrillers and this book was so different from anything I have ever read, but I felt as if I was actually transported to the time and place of this unusual, interesting read. My 90 year old Mom read it, too, and also loved it.  It's warm, endearing and so well written.

The novel is sure a pleasant surprise. First, I like how the author interlaces the novel between the perspective of the older and younger antagonists. Mr Jankowski is animated and adorable. I felt like I could really take a glimpse inside an old person's mild. He is a young guy trapped in an old man's body. Jacob is young and innocent, but not as memorable as his older self. The adventure he had is almost like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. Sure, there were times I was confused. It doesn't seem so believable to have a college graduate jumping from one railcar to another, and the sex scene is unnecessarily. (I guess female readers demand certain rewards with reading romance novels.) {Spoiler Alert} I still don't understand why Uncle Al needs August for the circus. It seems like Uncle Al could have just replaced August with Jacob and the novel will shortened by half.I wish Ms Gruen all the best and am looking forward to her coming books.

"Water for Elephants" is a good read.  The writer confesses to being thrilled to be writing something besides technical documents, and this gives rise to minor annoyances, some as trivial as the overuse of "stare".The contrast of mores of the Depression Era to modern day is arrestingly authentic.  Using 1930's circus lingo is misleading (a "bull" elephant named Rosie).The symbolism that is not overtly contrived (the big circus in the sky) is captivating, but there is an the almost desperate struggle to parallel the narrator with the biblical story of Jacob.

This is the story of Jacob J from two points of view - Jacob the old man, in the "assisted living" facility and Jacob the young man, newly orphaned, trying to make his way in the world.Jacob the elder is a grumpy old curmudgeon. And, as you read the book, from his POV, you understand why. His body has failed him, his mind isn't as sharp as it was, and his keepers treat him like a child. He is unbelievably frustrated. But he has a family that visits him regularly, and he has something to look forward to. The circus has come to town.Seeing the circus has taken him back to his youth, during the depression, when he ran away from life and joined the circus. The chapters that take place during this point in time are riveting, capturing the essence of what we could never experience.There's mystery, romance, and some really great characters. And, I think the author does a good job of capturing the essence of this proud male character. Great read.

Seeing Jacob young and old, and hearing how time affected him, and how he still remained connected to his history after all those years was  great. It really added to the book and really tied the story together for me. It was very dramatic for me to see how this once active and interesting man was effected by the years, and what age does to a person. It made me think how we cast aside many of our elderly friends and folks not paying attention to their stories. Especially key when thinking alone about Jacob's past. I have a great love and respect for elephants and at many times i was so angered in the story and could feel the emotions that Jacob was experiencing. It was such a strong event that occurred with Rosie, and without giving the story away was vindicating. Really don't want to watch the movie now as afraid would not live up to how i imagined everything or if they changed the story too much.

So much has already been written about the shallow characters and implausible ending... So no need to belabor that point.However, I do want to throw up a Red Flag to those readers who, like me, aren't big fans of profanity. I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere. As to the rest, it could've been toned down.

Great and dramatic character development, some you love, some you care about, some you hate and one or two you simply loathe...great characters living life with all of its pathos, humor and drama in a Depression era circus...Some points will make you laugh out loud, some smile in suprise and some where you want to say, "That sorry, no good SOB..."  Some will make you gasp in joy and delight, one or two in horror. All in all, a very good book....The characters, the pathos and the humor, the living of life, make it come alive and stay with you long after the last page is turned.  I was sorry to seen it end, and that is the way a good book is supposed to leave you. This one is good, though it never really talks about or explains the title "Water for Elephants..."

I was excited because I suspected that this was a book must have been written for me. I have always been a circus enthusiast and I was particularly interested in the details and the workings of a circus during the depression era.  The amount of research is impressive.  I agree with the other reviewers that the sections concerning the old man in the nursing home were probably the best written.  Unfortunately, the part that I had the least patience with is the love triangle.  That, of course, is the main engine for the plot. I didn't think the writting was as clunky as some claimed. I would have liked to have known more about the elephant. Where I'm from the nursing home takes all those who want to go to the circus or where ever, even if it is 60 miles away. And what's this deal with people writting novels about characters and events that are as far removed from themselves as possible?  It must be a reaction against Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, etc., but those were some pretty good writers. I enjoyed the topic, but I hoped to like this book more.

I had a hard time putting this book down, not because it was action packed or particularly fast paced, but because the development, sincerity and engaging voice of the main character at both stages of his life was refreshingly flawless. The voice remains true and believable throughout the entire narrative and is well developed giving me a clear picture of who Jacob Jankowski is and why I should care. Because this is achieved, I am fully invested in his world and experiences. Like wise, the supporting characters are dynamic and interesting, but even given their deformities, whether physical or psychologically, they never over shadow the main character.The book provokes thoughts on treatment and intelligence of animals, economy, marriage, class, race, healthcare, friendship and family. As well as, it forces us to take a hard look at how our culture deals with the elderly."Sometimes the monotony of bingo and sing-alongs and ancient dusty people parked in the hallway in wheelchairs makes me long for death. Particularly when I remember that I'm one of the ancient dusty people, filed away like some worthless tchotchke."If I had to give a 'con' to the book, it would be toward the ending when the author simplifies Jacob's journey with a 'run away with the circus' solution. However, this does not disappoint and in a way is the logical path and most appropriate ending given the character's circumstances and alternative. It is the happiest it can get.

Seldom has a book moved me as much as this one did.  Perhaps it's because I listened to the audiobook version, and the narrators voices were perfect for the different stages of life in the book.  Perhaps it's because my 98 year old mother-in-law is in a nursing home, but the author captured what life for a 90+ year old must be like in a nursing home facility.  In addition, I LOVE the circus, even though today's pale in comparison to those that were under canvas.  Without doing a spoiler, I can only say that it's been a long time since the ending of a book brought tears to my eyes.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a sweeping story of nearly epic proportions that touches on the young, the old, and lost loves, all within one man's life.His name is Jacob Janowski, a grumbling old 93-year-old (or is it 90-year-old?) fart living in an old folks home. Enduring his final days with other old folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read. It also, surprisingly, has a ton of character depth, and not just for human characters but for the animals Jacob tends. Particularly that of Rosie the "dumb as hammers" elephant that turns out to be much, much more than what she seems.The ending to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS was absolutely perfect, letting us know that even though the elderly can be crotchety, they serve a much greater purpose than to be wheeled around in chairs and told when, what and where to eat, drink, and think. Finding a home where one belongs is the toughest thing when people get older, and it was a fantastic ending for Jacob to "go home" to when the final sentence gets read.

Rarely do I enjoy books that are recommended to me as much as I enjoyed Sara Gruen's 'Water For Elephants'. A charming, touching, entertaining read from start to finish; the book's frequent 'travels in time' from a depression era college boy experiencing loss and uncertainty at a young age to a 90+ year old man also experiencing loss and uncertainty, while reliving his past and trying desperately to maintain as much dignity as possible in face of his diminishing capacity with old age.The story begins with the older Jacob Jankowski, infuriated with a newer resident at his assisted living facility who, with the advent of a circus arriving nearby, delights and entertains his female dining hall companions with stories of how he carried water for elephants at the circus in his younger years. Jacob; who is incensed at this obviously false claim, and alienates himself from the rest of the residents, begins to relive, through a series of remembrances in his mind, his own experiences in the Benzini Brothers circus in his youth.With a cast as colorful as the balloons and flags that you can imagine flying over the bigtop of the Benzini Brothers circus, Jacob's internal narrative weaves a tale of love, loss, betrayal, and murder that is as fine a coming of age story as I have ever read.A thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish.

I've just completed reading this book a third time. One word of advice:  Read the book BEFORE seeing the movie. While both book and film can each stand alone, reading the book first makes the movie so much more enjoyable.  The story is uniquely compelling, and the author does an excellent job of describing the life and times of a Depression-era circus. I just couldn't put the bloody book down!Like the author before writing this book, I'd never been to a circus before. However, I did grow up with Depression survivor grandparents, especially my grandmother, who was infamous locally for feeding the hobos who passed through our poor little railroad town. Even when she had little to feed her three children, the transients who spotted the hobo tags on their back fence never went away empty-handed.I have been fascinated by stories of the circus since visiting the Ringling Circus Museum in Sarasota, Florida at the age of eight. Now in my 50's, I long to see a real circus for myself.

Shes innocent, smart, witty, out smarts her humans and seemingly has a wonderful personality. She is amazing. But of course this book is not just about an elephant. Its about love, hate, excitement, tyranny, rage, and some real good laughs. Definitely a book worth reading.

While I don't completely regret reading this book about a young man who joins the circus as a vet in the 1930's, in hindsight I defintely would have chosen another book. It starts off with a bang, then slows down significantly in the middle, and it ends quite nicely. It's your typical boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl story. I did enjoy the historical fiction aspect of it and I truly enjoyed the final portion of the book where the author writes about why, how, and what she did to write this book.I'd recommend it to the causal reader, but a more sophisticated reader may want to look elsewhere.

I was really impressed by this book. It's an old man's retelling of his younger days at a circus. He's currently in a nursing home. What's amazing is how she takes you inside his head and causes you to see events through his eyes, and his mind. You feel his frustration, his loneliness, and how he's misunderstood.Older people in the home are treated like children, but inside, they're cognizant, at least some of the time, and resent this treatment, but are helpless to prevent it.The details in the circus era are very well written. You're taught a lot about circus life, the fun, the dangerous, the dark underbelly. Maybe it's not representative; it is fiction, but you believe it. She takes you there.One of the most enjoyable fiction books I've read.

I Bought this one on a whim as my favorite authors seemed to have dried up a little. I'm so glad I did, it's wonderful.Jacob Jankowski is 93 (hr thinks) and in an old folks home put out to pasture. He has an enthralling story inside him that many of us only wish we had. Dropping out of college and running away with the circus as a young man, his story unfolds as a true adventure.The circus of the 30's is the back drop for this wonderful yarn and we follow Jacob as he navigates his way around the people, the lore, the language and the pecking order. All the characters are colorful and each brings a dimension to the story that has the reader turning pages as fast as possible. I think I blew through this one in two days. I might have done it in one had I not had commitments I had to keep.The story is interspersed with up to date goings on at the old folks home the aged Jankowski is a resident of but, you can just tell his heart is still on the circus train of his youth. The end of the book is perfect in its simplicity and "rightness".To say I thoroughly enjoyed this book would somehow understate the whole experience, to say I loved it would be closer to the truth. If you want something to read that will draw you in like a moth to a flame, this might just be the book. If you want to be taken back to a bygone age of Americana complete with all its misgivings and mayhem, this might be the story. If you want to immerse yourself in a great story that, I hope becomes a movie, this IS the book.

SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT I READ THIS BOOK.  I HAVE OBSERVED PEOPLE READING THIS BOOK ON AIRPLANES, IN CARPOOL LINES, SITTING ON A BENCH AT BARK PARK, SO I DECIDED IT WAS A MUST READ JUST TO FEEL LIKE I BELONGED IN A SOCIETY.  THE BOOK IS INTERESTING, PARTICULARLY IF YOU WERE FASCINATED WITH THE CIRCUS AS A YOUNG CHILD.  I FOUND THE ANIMAL BRUTALITY A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS I HAD ANTICIPATED, BUT WHAT I DID MOSTLY REMEMBER AT THE END.  IT'S A GOOD READ, NOT A GREAT READ.  THE ONLY FLAW I WOULD MENTION IS THE NARRATOR'S VOICE WAS NOT PLAUSIBLE AS A NINETY YEAR OLD MAN.  THE AUTHOR MIGHT HAVE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH IN THAT AREA, BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM READING THE BOOK.

Wow!  There are over 1,600 reviews for this book.  That's great because this is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many.This novel is about a young man, nearly finished with his veterinary studies who, because of economic circumstances leaves school to join a circus as its resident veterinarian.This book switches back and forth from the standpoint of the veterinarian in his older years to the present time.  As an old man, he looks back at his experiences and the crises in the life of his great love, Dolly.  Dolly loves horses and elephants and is in a relationship with an abusive man who is in charge of the circus.The protagonist's relationship with his roommate, a dwarf, and the dwarf's Jack Russell Terrier, are wonderfully characterized.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and recommend it highly.

Well written story of circus life, the people and circumstances that brought the traveling big top to our lives. You can almost smell the sawdust, the action, the intensity of the people who made this such a happening in the small cities of 20th century America.

Having aging parents, I was captivated by the opening of the book...The novel, the story in which the historical facts of the train circus are interwoven, appeals to any person's compassionate emotions...I really enjoyed the book, even beyond my expectations.

This is wonderful book!  Ever curious about what happens behind the scenes of a circus?  Well this story shows that it's nothing like you've ever imagined.  Jacob Jankowski is en route to become a veternarian when all of a sudden he loses his parents and everything changes.  He decides to run away and runs into a traveling circus.  He eventually gets a job with them as their "vet", and gets an inside look on the running of the circus.  But wait, now Jacob is a 90... or is it 93 year old man living in a dull nursing home.  The way that this novel flashes back and forth between the present old man and the past young Jacob as his story with the circus and the excentric characters he meets there adds a wonderful effect to this story.  It's a must read, once you pick up the book, you won't want to put it down until the end.  You'll never believe the crazyness behind the freakshows and the secretive and passionate characters behind the facade of happiness.

&#8203;This #1 NY Times Bestseller, Water for Elephants (&#8220;WFL&#8221;) was released as a film with Reese Witherspoon in 2011, and it offers us a timeless revelation of something that most of us could never fathom, the bygone era of traveling circus life, with grippingly real characters, at an astonishing depth from an author who is too young to know such vernacular much less in depth, and all the wretched animal smells, the poverty of that life, it's inherent tragedies, sprinkled with humor, intrigue and life&#8217;s intensity.  All of this is given to us from the senescent eyes of one "90 or 93", and it leaps through his semi-dementia-blurred eyes to his eyes as they were decades past -- the animated, vibrant mind of a large, strong and most admirable, but real, young man, Jacob/Jake Jankowski, a vetenarian, trained at Cornell University among America&#8217;s elite privileged classes, who fell into the depths of the morass of the Americana that one would expect circus-life to reflect.&#8203;Her novel is a much-heralded classic, as modern literature might define it, even if its prose are not of classical stature; the story that she weaves is captivating indeed.  She presents this historical-fiction view of circus life primarily as dialogue, very believable at that and so worth the time to read it, but it wants for more descriptive passages and philosophy to feed our starved minds.  Still, when she is of a mind to do so, she writes memorable lines, thus sprinkling her fascinating plot with tasteful, descriptive metaphors and similes which never impede the flow of the story line nor irritate the spellbound reader.  The plot drifts dreamlike between the disquieting realities of old age and its debilitating manifestations and the all-too vivid memories of circus life and the tragic and wonderful characters and griping events that then unfold.&#8203;Clearly, she has studied seniors and their halting routines in assisted living facilities, and she makes them all too real.  With this, I have two problems.  First, seniors' lives are boring and, worse, awash in sadness.  Second, for one of my age, they strike frighteningly close to home, increasing the appeal of some later self-extinction, a far preferable denouement than the gradual withering and atrophy that time assures.  As such, I rapidly flipped through the chapters dwelling on Jacob's painful, senescent existence.  On balance, I horoughly enjoyed learning so much about circus life in America some 100 years ago and all of the characters and plots of WFL.  Brava, Sara Guen.  Ms. Guen is a Canadian, who now resides in America with her husband and sons.  Yes, it IS worth your time.  4 Stars  BookAWeekMan [...]

I have seen this book on the best seller list for a long time now.  I would read the reviews here on amazon, pick it up in the bookstore only to put it down again, thinking this just isn't my type of book.  A few weeks ago I was talking with a collegue about recent books we have read.  She told me she just finished Water for Elephants.  Usually we like the same sort of books, so I had to ask her what she thought, I told her I just never bought it because it seemed so not interesting.  She encouraged me to read it, she said it was wonderful.Well, she was right!  It was amazing.  It read like a true story, and I am sure the author did her research. This book really made you feel for the main character, in current time and his past with the circus. It was sad at times, but also funny and thoughtful.  I read it in less than a week and it was one of those books that although you coudn't wait to see what happened, you didn't want it to end.

Water for Elephants is an entertaining read that chronicles the life of Jacob, a circus' veterinarian (well, would have been if he would have taken his final exams). The story is told in alternating time periods, Jacob recounting his youth from the confines of an assisted living facility. After the horrific death of his parents during the Great Depression, Jacob drops out of school and begins working with the Benzini Brothers circus. He quickly discovers the dark secrets so well-hidden behind the cheerful, humorous faade of circus shows. While on the road Jacob grows up and learns a great deal about life "out in the real world" while traveling with the circus, including lessons on friendship, trust, love and self-reliance.This novel is extremely plot driven and is not a literary challenge by any means. I appreciate the take on circus life; this isn't something that is commonly written about. It was still very enjoyable and interesting, and I would recommend it for all readers.

Loved every bit of this book. The narration is well-planned...we follow Jacob Jankowsi, a would-be vet with his father until his parents are killed in a car crash. Jacob hits the road, and one night jumps on a train. Little does he know that that one jump will change his life forever--for the better and the worst.Gruen delights readers with circus life during the depression, with strong character development and a strong plot. You root for the animals, who are heinously mistreated by the ringmaster, and you root for the workers.

I was pleasantly surprised by this story.  Granted, it had wonderful reviews here on Amazon, but there have been other popular fiction novels with the same reviews, and I loathed those books.I don't need to go into any details as the book has been so thoroughly reviewed, but I will say there was so much in the book that touched me.  Ninety or ninety-three year old Jacob's story was so emotional...it's going to stay with me for quite awhile.  Bravo!

Water for Elephants is the first adult novel I've read and it certainly didn't disappoint.The story starts off with ninety-three year old Jacob Jankowski recounting his life as a young man training at Cornell to be a veterinarian. He drops everything when his parents die and joins the circus.Jacob was a very easily liked character. I'd have to say the flash forwards were something I really enjoyed. Gruen's seamless writing between past and present is breathtaking. Reading the difference between an older Jacob as opposed to a young one was really intriguing. It was interesting to hear him describe how his body has aged from the vital, handsome young man he once was and how he sees himself as this decrepit old man now. It was so sad but quite hysterical at the same time.I didn't feel like I connected with Marlena too much. Yes, I liked her as a character, but I had a hard time seeing what Jacob thought was so special about her. A character I had a hard time deciding whether or not I liked, from the moment he was introduced, was August. In the beginning you want to like him when he's befriending Jacob, but when he starts slipping up and showing that he is really a very cruel man you immediately switch to despising him.Now Rosie... what can I say about Rosie? She is the cutest elephant ever! I love how Gruen wrote her with such a loveable personality. Well, really how she wrote most of the animals with such great characteristics. Bobo the monkey was also super adorable. Needless to say, something that I had a hard time with while reading this was the animal cruelty. A while back, I read an article from PETA on how elephants - most circus animals, really - are treated and it was just awful. So it was really hard reading it in gruesome detail. But hopefully, it'll make people realize how circus animals are treated so they can make a stand against it.Overall, Gruen has created a beautifully written novel. Her vivid descriptions and accurate portrayal of life in the circus during the Depression were captivating. Not once did I feel that the story dragged on and the ending left me satisfied. I also felt that the pictures of the circus at the beginning of the chapters were a nice touch.I can't wait to see if I love the movie as much as I loved the book. Rob better not disappoint! ;)

Water for Elephants has recently taken over the spot of my favorite book. The book flawlessly alternates between the main character's present day experience in a nursing home and his memories of his life during his early 20's. I was skeptical about the switching at first since many books that do this are usually confusing and I have to keep turning back a few pages to see what time period I'm in, but the author does this perfectly.I completely fell in love with the main character, both the 92 year old and 23 year old versions of him. As someone who works in a nursing home, his experiences were so realistic and the author captured this perfectly.The book was extremely well written and it was obvious that Gruen did her research. I found myself looking for more information about travelling circuses and downloading pictures from them, especially elephants, after reading this.

I usually read romance or paranormal books but I got a gift cert. for $10 for itunes and this book was like $5 for an audiobook so I got it and I must admit that I really wasn't expecting to like this book but after I started it I stayed up all night and lessened to the whole 12 hours of it. I must admit that had I been reading the book I would have got bored with it because it does describe every nook and cranny in great detail but since it was an audiobook IT WAS AWESOME! there are two men reading the book a young guy and an older entailment which brought the story to life so I felt like I was there living the life of a circus vet. and an old man in a nursing home feeling left out and worthless who gained the power to.... uh well I best let you read the book for yourself instead of giving it away. It is one of the best reads I have ever heard!  :D I would worn that there is some language and some content that you might not want your young kids to hear or read and if you get offended at cussing and "impure" thoughts you might want to skip this one but I think most would over look those minor scenes.

I was fortunate enough to first listen to this story as an audio book. If you get the chance, I'd recommend you hear the audio book as hearing the main character in the voice of a young man and as an elderly male, added to the pleasure of discovering this circus love story. Because I was so impressed by the audio book i purchased the eBook so I could enjoy it all again on my Kindle. This one is a classic, in my opinion.

I read this books years ago when it came out and thought it was good, but not great.  I reread it as a book club selection and liked it much better due to the depth of characters.  The author has done her research in the life of the circus performers.  I hated the cruelty shown to some of the animals, but I know some of those things took place.  True love wins with the risks people are willing to take to be with their "soul mate".  The end is pretty unbelievable with an old man running away to join the circus (again).  However, it made me hopeful that this ignored man would find happiness in his last years.

I wish that I could say that I was one of the readers of  Water For Elephants, the well researched novel by Sara Gruen, who was graciously transported to the circus world of the 1930's, but sadly I can't.I am not one who acclaims the romance of  the beautiful Marlena, the circus horse rider and Jacob, whose personal tragedy causes him to walk away from his final exams at Cornell Vet school.  Instead, I am left thinking that perhaps, I should have read Twilight instead.  The an essential problem of reading a romance in which the reader does not care for the romantic protagonists, is that it takes the heart out of the book.Though there was enough in the side characters, animals and atmosphere to carry the book but alas there I often found Gruen's phrasing annoying and clunky.  I have decided in all fairness to Ms Gruen and her many fans that I will desist from reading any more of her works and we shall all continue on quite happily.

I'm pretty sure that no matter what I say I about this book, my words won't be able to do it justice.  It's an incredible book; brilliant, educational [to an extent] and highly entertaining.  By page ten I was hopelessly lost in its story, and fought sleep to stay awake and finish it.The story is told from the view point of a man named Jacob.  His viewpoint alternates between present time, where he is an elderly man in his 90's, in an assisted living facility which he despises, and also from the past perspective, as he recalls his days as part of a train circus in the 1930's.  When young Jacob's life turns upside down, he jumps a train, not realizing which particular train he jumped--and his world is changed forever.The story has a bit of everything; history, romance, animals, mental illness, corruption...its all in there, and its all in there in a way which leaves you incapable of putting the book down.  I learned a lot of things I didn't know before reading this book.  The intelligence of elephants is far higher than I ever gave them credit for.  I learned about the epidemic of "Jake Leg," which afflicted thousands of lower class folks in the 1930's.  Not to mention how much I learned about the inner working of the train circus industry.At the end of the story is a note from the author, which for that alone the book is worth reading.  Sara Gruen is very insightful and passionate, and I have a great deal of respect for her as a person and an author now.My words aren't doing this story any justice.  There's so much to it.  It's a complex work of historical fiction, and its one I hope you all read.

Jacob Jankowski is pushing 90 and wallowing in a nursing home, abandoned by his family and surrounded by aged octogenarians who irk him with their senility. He has few pleasures in life --- an astute and friendly nurse named Rosemary and his vibrant memories. As Jacob lies in his bed, drifting in and out of sleep, lucidness and dreams, the compelling story of his experiences as a young man unfolds in Sara Gruen's mesmerizing new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.The year is 1932. Jacob is 23 and just shy of getting his degree in veterinary medicine from Cornell when he learns that his parents have been killed in a horrific accident. Emotionally and monetarily stranded, unmoored and with nothing to lose, Jacob jumps a train and finds himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Starting at the bottom rung of the strict caste system within the ranks of the Circus employees, Jacob's veterinary knowledge quickly garners him a place near the top of the hierarchy, among the company of the hot-headed ringmaster August and his beautiful wife Marlena --- the all-purpose female star of the show.He also finds himself among the company of cantankerous midgets, gloriously endowed "men's entertainers" and a menagerie of exotic and soulful creatures. In her previous novels, Gruen has proven herself a master at depicting the uncanny and often astounding bond between humans and animals, and the scenes with Jacob and the creatures under his care are nuanced and lovely. Gruen paints each creature's persona with as much care and detail as she does for the humans, subtly illuminating the similarities and undermining the concept of human superiority. In the Depression-era setting of Jacob's tale, the survival of the humans is inextricably intertwined with that of the animals; they all live in a kind of chaotically symbiotic state where a star horse's sickness could spell bankruptcy and the chance for redemption lies in the acquisition of an elephant named Rosie.Exceptionally drawn as well is the development of a tentative bond between Jacob and Marlena. Jacob immediately is attracted to the lovely Marlena. She takes longer to reciprocate his affection, and throughout their cautious and hesitant budding romance the presence of Marlena's husband looms large and threatening. Gruen's pacing is excellent and the tension among Marlena, Jacob and August simmers and crackles before coming to a brutal and electrifying climax.The transitions back and forth in time, and the mundane events that unfold as Jacob moans and gripes through his days at the nursing home, could have been, in the hands of a less skilled writer, jarring and distracting, breaking the flow and drawing the reader out of the story. But while the crazed, dramatic and often spectacularly bizarre world of the Benzini Brothers is fascinating, as the novel progresses the reader becomes equally drawn into Jacob's present world. His disdain for his aged body and regret over the confusing array of relatives who visit him intermittently and whose names are permanently muddied in his mind is deeply poignant.Gruen spent years researching Depression-era circuses, and the breadth of her knowledge is revealed in all the tiny details that pepper Jacob's memories, but she also has a finely-tuned radar for the magic and mysteries of the human heart. The meat and madness of this novel may appear to lie in Jacob's memories of his younger self, but in her subtle exploration of Jacob as an old man, Gruen finds an equally compelling story.Readers may find themselves churning through this book at a rapid-fire pace, eager to see what lies ahead, then slowing down as they realize the pages are dwindling. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a book that can be read and reread, recommended and handed off between friends; it begs to be discussed and mulled over. With lines of startling beauty, haunting and evocative scenes and finely-drawn characters who dance off the page, readers can dip in and out of the novel, immersing themselves in Jacob's memories. The story and its characters will haunt readers long after they have resurfaced.--- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger

From the very start, this book had me completely drawn - I felt immediate compassion for the main character, the author really made me think about what it means to become old and "useless" in our society. I couldn't put this book down, the story unfolded at just the right pace, and the characters were very real and alive to me. After buying a few "duds" recently (including Last Night in Twisted River- how dull and poorly written for such a supposedly acclaimed author that one was) I was so refreshed to read a book that made me lose myself in the story.There are scenes that are very hard to read as an animal lover, but the characters you are meant to identify with are good people, trying to do the right thing. I don't like circuses at all because of all the animal abuse, so I almost didn't buy this book - but glad I did!

Gosh, how I cried while reading this book! It's such a beautiful and unforgettable story in so many ways, I don't even know where to begin explaining what an absolutely gorgeous must-read this is.The story is told with two voices. It starts with Jacob, a full ninety or ninety and three years old (he can't quite remember), coming to terms with aging and being left on his own by his children, in a facility for the aged; whilst looking back at his time as a drop-out veterinary student when he joined the circus after his parents death. The second voice is of Jacob during the three months he had joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931, and follows the story of him and Rosie the elephant; and him falling irrevocably in love with another man's wife - a love triangle with a difference, for sure. Both these story lines, Jacob as an old man and twenty three year old Jacob, deals with different sides and facets of Jacob.Sarah Gruen is a master character developer. Main and secondary role players were vividly painted as multi-dimensional characters. She wrote them in such a striking way that before you can stop yourself, you've lost your heart to quite a few of them, including the animals. Rosie, of course, is the star in this book and if nothing else, her trials and tribulations as well as her spectacular sense of humor, had me laughing and wiping tears at the same time.If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book yet, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. As great as the movie was, the book touched me on so many more levels than I could've imagined. I was riveted by the author's writing and the skilful manner in which she pulled me into Jacob's reality. I experienced so many emotions along with the various characters, and at times felt I could strangle August for what he put Rosie, Marlena and Jacob through.Most memorable line which made me smile: "Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of."The well-executed, fast-paced plot - fraught with twists and turns - also had moments of humor woven into it, and I finished this book feeling breathless from the anticipation, excitement and sheer excellence of this imaginative story and its realistically-sketched characters. It was clear to me that the author did in-depth research for this novel. If you don't purchase the book, at least watch the movie. But "Water for Elephant" definitely makes my list of top ten most memorable books that must be read in one's lifetime. Sara Gruen now has another proud new fan!

I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and was greatly surprised that I enjoyed it so much.  It is a story filled with such sad moments but also the promise of a happy future.  It is told in a wonderful way.  I enjoyed the whole ride from beginning to end.  There was some moments when I just wanted him to leave the damn circus already but do what exactly?  or go work where?  you realize how bad the economy was and at least here he was eating every day which might not have been the case anywhere else.

In a story spanning seventy years,  Water for Elephants starts in depression-era America as a young veterinary student named Jacob Jankowski who runs from tragic circumstances, joins a circus, and then reflects on his memories at the end of his life while in a home for the aged. This book is rich in themes. It is a story about coming of age, circus life, elephants, love, friendships, cruelty, mental illness, dignity, life in an old folks home, and old age itself. Author Sara Gruen has created a world of vivid characters and scenes centering on a traveling circus. Life in this environment can be harsh and cruel, but it also has a glamorous side and a close-knit community in which decency sometimes prevails. The reader will feel the chill of despair and revulsion, but also the emotions that warm one's heart. So much goes on in Water for Elephants that I will not begin to describe the plot or all the characters. Everything is unforgettable and I find myself wondering what happened where the story left off because there is a lot more to tell. I doubt Gruen will write a sequel, but I will eagerly await one if she does.

Water for Elephants is the story of Jacob Jankowski.  After a tragic accident involving his parents, Jacob feels lost and unsure of his future.  One night he hops a train - only to find that he's hopped a circus train.  Because he is "almost" a vetrenarian they welcome him aboard (although not that nicely or easily) and he quickly becomes embroiled in a very predictable love triangle.Gruen does a great job with the transition from the ruminations of 93 year-old Jacob in the nursing home to 22 year-old Jacob on the traveling circus.  They're seemless and very well done.  Reading about the circus and life on a traveling circus during the depression era was also interesting.My complaint with the novel lies in the fact that as a reader I felt the author just skimmed the surface with this novel.  The story was predictable and shallow, and while the characters were decently developed, the overall story line just wasn't that great, IMHO.I was disappointed.

I actually bought this book years ago, but just got around to reading it when I saw that the movie was out. I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her. It's a shame, because I love the idea, but it just did not cut it.If you want to read some great non-fiction about sideshows and entertaining attractions, check out Ricky Jay's books.

It took me a good 4 days to get halfway through this book before it finally caught my attention. It was okay, I wasnt drawn in immediately. If it wasnt for the old man perspective I would have completely disliked this book.

I enjoyed this book very much.  Full of detail and things I would have never suspected or imagined about a circus.  I must admit that I had some trouble with the scenes of animal (and even people) abuse but was able to skim quickly over it enough to get the picture but not dwell on it.  I know that this part of the book had to be told because I'm sure that it happened.  I did enjoy the animals (and people) revenge at the end greatly!  I especially loved the weaving of Jacob's story from old man to young and back again.  And of course the happy ending...well who could have asked for a better one.  Yep!  I loved this book.

This book had its moments, I cried and I smiled.  However there was a lot in between those moments that I ended up just glossing over.  I find that the book is normally better than the movie so I'm glad I read the book instead of watching the movie.  I don't think I could have sat for the whole movie.

My title for my book review is lifted from the editorial reviews, Valerie Ryan really nailed it for me.There are so many things to like about this book.  The very best thing is the firm grounding in historical fact.  This is what it was like in America during the Great Depression, this is why the travelling circus roustabouts worked and lived the way they did, because of the Depression.  They didn't always get paid but at least they ate.  Sara Gruen handles her historical data with an exceedingly light touch, she is a marvellous storyteller.  Memorable book, very engaging. I can understand why there are nearly four thousand reader reviews.

This is an excellent, well researched book.  The author obviously has a lot of empathy with the animals.  Descriptions of life on the circus train seemed genuine.  The ending that involved the elephant was a real surprise.  One criticisim I have is that all of Sara Gruen's books have happy endings.  I guess I'm just a Jude The Obscure kind of guy.

"I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other." So begins Sara Gruen's near love letter to the circus, and it's inhabitants. Told in flashbacks by the eldery Jacob Jankowski, it's how he came to work as the vet for the Benzini Brothers, a second rate Barnum and Bailey, traveling across the country. A cast of ragtag characters bring the bigtop to life including a little person named Walter, the sadistic ring master August, and his beautiful performer wife Marlena who Jacob desperately longs for.This would make a fanatastic movie if it isn't already in progress. It has all the elements, from melancholy sentiment, to sweeping romance, and the allure of the magical world of the three rings.

Have to say I'm wondering what all the fuss is about this book? Up to about page 190 I found it to be an enjoyable read and had mentioned it to friends. Alas from page 190 onwards I found it losing its grip...maybe it's too long?Most of the characters are underdeveloped to the point that much of the conversation between Jacob and the various circus folks could essentially take place between him and one other - they all sound the same. I've read peoples comments about the trials and tribulations of the characters living through the depression - it doesn't come anywhere close to a classic dealing with the same period, The Grapes of Wrath.The stampede at the end is a tad too contrived, surely the animals would be tearing themselves, and all around them, limb from limb given that they've attacked their handlers in the past. Same goes with Jacobs disappearance from the old peoples home - again too contrived.There is the makings of a great story here but I don't think Gruen is the one to tell it. The opening scenes have Blackie under the authority of Camel and then 3 months down the road Blackie is ejecting Camel from the train? Sorry it doesn't seem credible. August seems like a nasty piece of work but his paranoia was certainly well founded in the end; we're told that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia but does anyone help him out with it? Just seems a convenient way for Gruen to add a villain in to the mix...and I have to question would circus folks even know what it was in the first place, and surely his wife would have helped him try and figure it out..."I left my husband"..."why?"..."he was a paranoid schizophrenic"..."ah, OK, cool"...isn't life a little more complicated than that? And his ultimate demise and how it was conducted is a little far fetched.I guess I'm feeling let down - the book starts off well but alas doesn't maintain the quality. Also found the interview with Gruen to impart nothing of much substance and the "Questions for Book Groups" to be of a nature beyond the level of this book - Grapes of Wrath certainly gives rise to concerns about the depression, compassion etc. but this book doesn't. Alas it didn't deliver and I don't think I'll be reading anything else by Gruen based on this.Have to say that I'm a little disgruntled at the thought of Gruen has a couple of dollars of mine and undeservedly so; if I was Gruen I'd be asking myself whether the ending was worthy of the potential shown earlier in the book. Unfortunately, it's books like this that have me buying books secondhand, and for the most part reading the "classics"; they're classics as they've withstood the test of time - I can't imagine this book doing so. For authors I like I'm more than happy to buy a book new and in the process pay money to the author, but my disappointment with this book is such that I don't think Gruen deserves any reward for it and makes me realise what a financial risk one is making buying new books from untried authors.Why are there so few contemporary authors out there who are deserving of the praise that seems to be lauded upon them so easily these days? For those of you looking for a book that covers the darker aspects of humanity and their situations along with some wonderfully humourous moments then give "Suttree" a read by Cormac McCarthy - it's not the easiest of reads but rewards effort.

In the great depression, a young man drops out of Veterinary school and joins a travelling circus. The story unfolds in flashbacks from his present day existence in a nursing home. The author takes us into a world of cruelty, privation and danger, which is nevertheless full of adventure and the possibility of love. The story grabs you quickly. I couldn't put this one down. I told my friends about it, and the ones who actually started it were hooked too!The writer creates believable characters, and I found myself caring about them. Perhaps some were larger than life, but it helped the story. Was the circus really this grim and dangerous in the 1930's? I do not know, but Sara Gruen makes it entirely believable.This book occupied all of my spare time for several days, and that is just what I hope for when I pick up a new one. The ending was a little bit contrived, but I have forgiven authors for much worse. Get your hands on this one; you won't be sorry.

It's one of those rare books that is impossible to put down but after it's over, you feel like you learned a lot.I'm going to give away as little as possible about the storyline because I don't want to ruin anything, so I'll just give you a little background information. It is about the traveling circus back in the Great Depression Era and offers you a glimpse of a fantasy life that you'd never imagine on your own. She did tons and tons of research on circuses back then so everything is extremely realistic and she covers topics that have always interested me (like prohibition, speakeasies, and the intelligence of animals). To make the book even more relevant to readers today, she weaves the past in with the present to create a masterful story that you'll remember for years to come.A lot of times, after I finish reading a book I'll forget how it ended in just a few months... not in this case though, the ending gave me goosebumps and I'll always remember it vividly.

I had planned on watching the movie first because it looked good and  I can't usually watch a movie and enjoy it if I read and enjoyed the book first and vis versa. However, the book got better reviews than the movie and I didn't want to taint my experience with the story, so I picked up the book first and I'm glad I did.We are deliver the story through Mr. Jacob Jankowsky's ninety, or ninety-three year old memory. He can't remember his age but he remembers his life with the train traveling circus in the 1930's like it was yesterday. We see the excitement of a life as a circus worker and more often then not the dangers that the job presents, especially if you start to fall for the crazy jealous circus trainer's wife.

I love the setting, Jacob's flashbacks and the language barrier with Rosie. Definitely worth the few dollars it costs.

Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski, and almost-veterinarian whose life has just fallen apart. As he comes to this realization, Jacob stumbles upon the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus train and hops aboard. He quickly secures his place on the show as the menagerie vet, a position that will change his life forever.Sara Gruen weaves an incredibly realistic tale that allows the reader a rare glimpse into the prohibition era circus lifestyle. The amount of tension throughout the book is always palatable. I often found myself clenching my jaw and holding my breath by the end of a chapter. August is a particularly well-developed character, frightening in the most realistic and entirely plausible way. There is a sense of impending destruction and collapse that builds with each paragraph.This tension is gracefully relieved every few chapters by visiting Jacob, age ninety (or ninety-three), in his current state as a resident at an assisted living facility. Through the telling of Jacob's present story, the reader reaches another level of understanding and can comprehend the meaning of Jacob's earlier experiences in entirely new ways. The tale would be much less satisfying without this continuation of the story, however small it may seem.An issue that must be addressed when talking about Water for Elephants is the treatment of animals. Some scenes in the book are very difficult to read, but it's worth reading through. You will fall in love with so many of the animals as though they're human, and you will be satisfied with their redemption.For me, Water for Elephants receives 5/5 stars. I consider it a "must read" that will forever change the way you think. It's the type of story that won't soon leave your mind.

I have owned this book for a few months. I keep getting side tracked by other books so I did not read it. Last week so many people told me how wonderful the book was and even the movie. SO, I picked it up last night and am almost done with it. WOW!!! What a wonderful story. You can tell a lot of research went into this by the accuracy. While I know very little about circus life I do work with the elderly and that is all accurate. A lot on the lines of "The Notebook" the way the story in told.

Sara Gruen did a fantastic job of recreating the circus life in the 1930's as well as presenting us with the daily struggles of living of a contemporary man in his 90's who lives in a nursing home.  This man is the main protagonist of the novel, who recounts his story from his last days in vet school whose life trajectory takes him to the circus after a tragic incident.  The novel is rich with visual imagery of circus life - the animals, the workers, the performers, the props, the train travel etc - and as rich with the depressing conditions of a nanogenarian living in a nursing home - the daily struggles to handle basic life skills, relationships with the staff and other residents, and, saddest of all, the knowledge of the sense of loss of one's memory, and with that, the eventual loss of connection to relatives.  The narrative moves quickly and aggressively, taking the reader back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, with each venue progressing dramatically towards its conclusion.  The main charcater, Jacob, is sympathetic, and you root for him all the way, accompanying him along his travails of adjustment to circus life and his love interest.  You get wrapped up in the drama and stay along eagerly on the ride.Here are my minor objections(The first is directed at author and editor.):  In a span of two pages the author uses the exact same phrase regarding some anticipated emotion from different characters.  It's jarring to read, and you go back to see if you misread it - but no.  Not a big deal but it interrupted the flow.  Bad enough, but the same phrase (or almost the exact same phrase) appears again near the end of the book about the same emotion, and, once again, I'm jarred and lose the focus of the story.  It seems like an amateurish mistake by author or editor.The other problem I had was that, at times, some of the circus characters were borderline stereoptypical/cartoonish, as if the protagonist is one of a few only real people.  Finally, the concluding chapter had some elements to it of a Hollywood happy ending, with an implausible change of attention from tragedy to negotiation.

Page after page this novel is filled with interesting facts, experiences and history. That it's a memoir of a patient/resident of a nursing home is a literary vehicle of genius. How remarkable to live the life of a this young man, one we can easily identify with, through this period of American history (30's, 40's) only to end up with him in a current-day nursing home, the finest of which are lonely places indeed.My wife and I just recently visited an uncle who lived in a very fine nursing home in another state and were pronounced "saints" by the staff who said no one ever visits these people. That's why I'm haunted by the ending of this book.I've also paid more attention to stories of the intelligence of elephants, their almost human sense of justice. Perhaps I mean their more-than-human sense of justice.A wonderful book. You will be glad you read it.

The archetypical American novel features a solitary protagonist undertaking an odyssey in which he/she confronts both physical and moral challenges and through which he/she emerges with a renewed spirit, transformed by the crucible of confrontations with adversaries, both real and imagined.  Sara Gruen's engaging "Water for Elephants" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life.  Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero.  "Water for Elephants" is a triumph  --  of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.The innocent Jacob, on the threshold of graduating from Cornell veterinary school and returning to the Midwest to practice medicine with his father, is shattered by the sudden accidental deaths of his parents.  Unmoored from his past and unable to focus on his final examination, he abandons his former life the moment he jumps on board a passing train.  To his astonishment, he has leaped into the midst of a traveling circus, and, thanks to the flinty care of several roustabouts, manages to gain employment with the tawdry Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus dominated by a sadistic ringmaster and populated by a cast of characters, admirable and evil in equal proportions.  In a manner of weeks, Jacob immerses himself as the circus "vet," forms abiding friendships, falls is love and faces moral dilemmas that tie his conscience into Gordian knots.Some critics have likened Jacob to his biblical counterpart and praised the novel for its allusions to the Bible.  In my opinion, Jacob mirrors a less sanctified model, Huckleberry Finn.  Like Huck, Jacob flees familiar surroundings, flaunts social norms, befriends outcasts and risks his personal safety in order to adhere to a hard-earned sense of conscience and social responsibility.  Both Huck and Jacob confront mendacious adversaries, rejoice in life on the lam and re-invent themselves.  Like Twain, Sarah Gruen writes with inordinate respect about the dispossessed and with painful awareness about the inexplicable capacity for the human heart to do well in the midst of spiritual darkness.  As Twain has written  --  and as Gruen affirms  --  the source of humor is pain.Even the title bespeaks our capacity for misrepresentation.  The elderly Jacob, shunted away by his family in a assisted-living nursing home, excoriates a new resident who has claimed to have carried water in buckets for elephants when he was a youngster.  Aware of an elephant's enormous drinking capacity, Jacob knows a lie when he hears one.  And well he should.  The entire purpose of the traveling circus is deception, an enterprise where rubes are separated from their money by gaping at mangy animals, staring at sideshow freaks (many of whom are frauds) or being serviced by "exotic dancers."  Falsehoods, illusions and duplicity are the moral big tent under which circus performers enchant Depression men and women hungry for escape.  The central conflict of the novel rotates around Jacob's involvement with a married woman and the peculiarly disturbing aspects of her husband's mental state.  This conflict is rife with secrecy, duplicity and tormented twisting of ideas of right and wrong.It is no surprise that this novel is a best-seller.  Written with extraordinary narrative drive, populated by characters who truly represent our national character and animated by a young man whose journey for self-discovery is our own, "Water for Elephants" intimately involves us in Jacob Jankowski's search for meaning.

Water for Elephants offers some thing for everyone.  If you're a pragmatist you will love the research and facts concerning the circus of the depression era.  If a romantic, the ending will be for you. If you are young, the choices and frustrations suffered by Jacob will be yours. For me, a senior citizen, the gerentology  added greatly to the story.I thought it a great read especially since there are 70 years between the youth and aged of the story which is told in flashback form. There is little in common between the two periods of time except for love and the anticipation of all ages.Try it, you will like it.

Amazing book which brings us into the life of a student at Cornell whose life changes dramatically and rapidly within a few days - and, as with all persons, those dramatic changes influence the rest of his life.  The story is of a circus worker during the depression...and it brought back some vague memories of my early childhood, watching a small circus roll into town, watching the elephants parade through from the train depot and to a farmer's field where the "Big Top" would suddenly sprout with flags a-flying.  The story is told from the view of the worker who's now in his 90's...and is fascinating as to how the author mixes past and present to give a picture of an amazing whole.

I really dislike everyone in this book. I'll pass on criticizing the weak writing & the obvious lack of credible research (various other one star reviews have covered that) and instead attack the characters: Jacob is a stupid d**che, Marlena is a stupid tw*t, and August is just an a-hole.Jacob is supposed to be a vet/animal caretaker but what does he do? He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?! I'm not brushing off wife-beating here, but really?! One flipping black eye and August deserves to die? I would have killed that bastard for beating AND torturing Rosie LONG BEFOREHAND!! And then Jacob keeps harping about it: "He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses "paranoid schizophrenia" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be "paranoid," turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though. It's a simple, easy read with little to no thinking required.

Water for Elephants is loaded with interesting words because Sara Gruen owns a commanding vocabulary, and utilizes her well-chosen words with precision.  She also understands how to set the hook and carefully reel her reader in.  She's a master angler.The story is entertaining and the setting--a train circus-- is interesting.  Obviously Gruen heavy research is what birthed the rich detail.While some call this a romance book, the romance is lacking and rushed.  This is more of an action-adventure "who done it."

I was given this book to borrow -- "It is just a wonderful book." I cannot stand mediocre writing, and for this reason I don't often read popular fiction. I pushed into it, however, hoping for the best. Just could never care at all about the characters. The old guy is grumpy and resentful. Some of the circus behind-the-scenes reporting is interesting, but much of that is pretty low-life and tawdry. Not for me. I will read the ending and report back to my friend, but I will not read the rest of it.

My hatred for this book knows no bounds. This is the trashiest thing to infiltrate the literature section of the bookstore since Henry Miller. (Although I'm not a Henry Miller expert, I'm guessing he at least brought some literary merit to the table, which is more than I can say for this author!) The depression-era circus setting, although intriguing, was not enough to make up for the endless vulgarity, flat characterization and vapid dialogue. And, to make matters worse, no character, at least from the ones I can remember, is spared horrific scenes of physical abuse - you name it, woman, worker, elephant, dog, clown. I just got tired of it all after a while.Why did I even bother to finish it? It was sort of like watching Ripley's Believe it or Not to see what kind of ghastly thing would happen next. Well now I believe it; this is one of the worst contemporary books I've read.

Set in post-Depression America and the Benzini Brother's Circus, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is full of emotions and flashes of great humor. All the characters, including the animals, all have pivotal roles throughout the story. This book is a great blend of history, mystery, love story and memoir.Highly recommend with 5 stars!!!

I usually don't like to read women authors, Tess Gerritson and Alex Kava are the exceptions, but Sara has done a great, great job. I can hardly wait now to see the movie. I hope Sara had a lot to do with writing the movie script.  So many really good books stories are ruined when it comes to be a movie.

In the beginning of Water For Elephants Jacob Jankowski tells us that he is 90 or 93 (who can really be certain anymore?) His body betrayed him years ago and Jacob now fears that his mind isn't far behind. Shuffling along miserably behind his walker, he's living out his final days in the nursing home and hating every minute of it. Just another invisible senior citizen who's family and the world as a whole has forgotten about.When the circus comes to town and sets up its Big Top tents across the street Jacob comes alive and through a series of flashbacks begins to tell us his life's story. Taking us back to when he joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth, a traveling circus he toured with during the great depression.At the age of 23 Jacob had a predictable future set out ahead of him, one that certainly didn't involve joining the circus. However with his parents untimely death and the bank foreclosing on his family home Jacob soon finds himself homeless, heartbroken and mentally quite unable to sit his final veterinary exams. When an exotic, animal filled train steams toward him Jacob doesn't even think. Flinging himself aboard the boxcar and inadvertently changing his destiny forever.I absolutely adored this book, alternately falling in love with both Jacob, the crotchety old man and Jacob, the young, moral and penniless circus veterinarian. Water For Elephants transported me to another time and quickly became one of those books I never wanted to end.Author Sara Gruen has researched the depression era circus life down to the smallest of details and I feel that this captivating and vivid story will appeal to almost anyone.Filled with action, adventure and a sweet forbidden romance there is also a fascinating sideshow of secondary characters including a clever Polish Elephant, a grouchy little person as Jacob's roommate and a cruel and schizophrenic animal trainer whose wife Jacob just happens to fall in love with. All of this has been wrapped together with a compelling and innovative behind the scenes look aboard a travelling circus train. Showing us more often then not the darker side of circus life after the big top closes down. This is a love story, a life story, an animal lover's story but above all it's a circus story and who of us hasn't dreamed about running away and joining the circus at some point in our lives? And the ending... *sigh*I can't say enough good about this book, its easily one of my favourite reads this year and with Robert Pattison now taking on the upcoming movie role version of Jacob, I was able to picture him while reading, making it all the more sweeter.

Not going to lie, I bought this so I could read it before the movie came out (Robert Pattinson fan :-P).  While it was an easy read, I didn't love it. I found it difficult to appreciate the circus life with the description of it, but the characters were interesting.  The ending surprised me, so I loved that!  Nothing worse than a predictable novel.  There were many endearing and HUMAN situations and characters of the novel, so I found myself rooting for some characters and hating others.  Not every book I read invokes that kind of emotion in me.This story is a some-what of a page turner and (again) an easy read, but there was some kind of disconnect.  I can't quite define what was missing from this book, but I think it's worthwhile.  Would be great for a book club.

Water For Elephants is one of the best books I have read this year. Initially, I did not have any interest in reading this book because it involved a circus and I am not a huge fan of circuses. But at the insistence of some friends, I picked it up and began reading. Boy am I glad I did!Jacob Jankowski is a young man who is thrust mercilessly into the aftermath of the cruelties of life. Despite his circumstances, however, he is a good and honorable man and his compassion and honor shine through on every page of this book. He is a character that reader's immediately fall in love with and can relate to on some level or another. The story itself grabs you instantly and takes you back to a time where traveling circuses were the biggest events in town.Set in the 1930's, Water For Elephants offers a glimpse into a very strange and wonderous world of circus folk during a time when many, if not most, of the country was unemployed and doing anything they could to earn a buck or at least a meal. It was fascinating to read of the lifestyle of the circus workers and how they were treated, how they related to one another, how they treated their animals and what they thought of the townspeople they traveled the country to entertain.Water For Elephants is also a story that tells of the love and life of Jacob and Merlena and their love for the animals that they come to know while working with them in the circus. The book is beautifully and vividly written, the characters well developed and easy to love (or hate as the case may be) and the animals' antics, especially Rosie, will make you laugh out loud.Water For Elephants is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it!

I just spent the last fifteen minutes looking at the reviews ~~ and it's very interesting to read all the comments as well. There are so many varied responses to this book that the author must be in heaven to get so many responses to this book.I first heard of this book last spring when a fellow Amazon reviewer told me that I "just had to read it." I wasn't that inclined since the price was not favorable and the waiting list at the library was too long. However, in my book club, it was the November book to discuss. So when I saw it on the table at the local bookstore for buy three, get one free, I snapped it up. It is not a decision that I have regretted. It is one of the better entertaining books of fiction that I have read this year, if not one of the best. And I read a lot.There are some disaparities in this book as with others, but I think people tend to forget that a work of fiction is simply that, a work of fiction. Not everything's going to "mesh together" as in real life. That's why you read nonfiction if you like everything in its proper place and order. This book is simply a fanastic tale of a man facing the end of his life in a dreary nursing home setting, and reliving some of the best moments of his life. A young orphan who happened to jump the train to get away from the tragedy that was his life happened to be on a circus train. He didn't plan to run away to the circus, he just stumbled on the circus train while grieving. And stayed. Fell in love with the most beautiful girl in the world who is happened to be married to the ringmaster. What a story!This novel alternates between Jacob's present and past ~~ he relives the first three months of being in Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and seventy years prior, he was the Benzini Brothers' vet, taking care of the underfed animals of that show. He worked with all kinds of people and animals. It was an exciting life ~~ how many people do you know that lived a life like that? Marlena is the wife of the psychotic ringmaster who alternately abused his wife, his animals and co-workers. Rosie is the elephant bull that Uncle Al, the owner of the circus, bought for a song, hoping that Rosie will be the biggest draw to his circus.The descriptions in this novel are lavish. One can see the sawdust in the air as the big top was put up. One can see the cotton candy being spun. One can feel the humiliation of an old man having to take a shower under the watchful eye of the nurse in the nursing home. One can feel his love for the beautiful show girl. And all of this is tied together beautifully, both past and present. It is a glimpse into a life of a man.Why didn't I give it a five star? Simply because I felt that the endings to both stories were rushed. I did not expect it to have such happy endings since the stories were more gritty and realistic. But hey, this is a work of fiction, right?11-4-07

Since it was/has been made into a movie.  And as usual the book is always better than the movie.  But the movie does follow the book pretty well.  You just don't get the back story on everything that you do by reading the book.

I know that not one book is for everyone, but I honestly cannot imagine someone not loving Water For Elephants. I didn't go into it expecting to fall in love, but that's exactly what I did. The story, told through an elderly and retirement-home bound Jacob Jankowski, takes us on a journey as he recalls life on the circus. Hopping on a train, Jacob is looking for an escape from life at home where he has lost everything dear to him. He discovers that the old train is carting a circus show, and eventually gets himself a job. Along the way he falls in love with the majestic circus act, the amazing animals, and of course, the young and beautiful Marlena.I was repeatedly impressed by the great and believable depth of the characters in this book, including Marlena's ill-tempered and abusive husband, August. Jacob,the main character, stays strong and consistent throughout the entire story. I liked how he came to the rescue of all in need and didn't back down when the going got tough. His heroic acts and the fantastic tale that go along with it make this a five-star read in my book!

Interesting book that makes you want to keep reading, but in the end, it seems like the author tried too hard to wrap things up and make everyone happy.I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House

Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion.

Water for Elephants is an interesting text because it is not especially well written, the story is pure soap opera, and yet it is an enjoyable read that at times evokes a long gone era. I think it suffers from overly effusive praise and so many readers are bitterly disappointed once they get through it.First, let's look at the strengths of the novel. I enjoyed the evocations of circus and train life. Gruen clearly spent some time working on these descriptions of circus life and there are little Depression era details that were nice historical jewels for the reader to mine. Also effective was her characterization of old Jacob. His voice was witty and biting and he provided the most pleasure of any character in the text. Chapter nineteen of the novel is the saddest depiction of rest home life I have read in literature. A man is forgotten by his family, and the scene is heartbreaking.Now to examine the reasons why this book is unsatisfying. First off the characters from the 1930s parts of the novel are some of the weakest characterizations I have seen in a book in a long time. They are stock characters at best, and the villains are the mustache twirling men from melodrama. It is hard to care about any of the characters because they are so transparently fake. Even more distracting then the weak characterization is the incredibly insipid (and modern sounding) dialogue Gruen puts in their mouths. She has such nice historical details in the setting of the text, why couldn't she also use it in the dialogue?Many readers have found the ending unsatisfying, and although it is ridiculous, it fits the novel so I won't argue with it. The cloying depiction of animals is also a little beyond the pale, but again, I simply had to come to terms with the novel for what it is. It is popular fiction. It is a melodrama you will get caught up in. And for those purposes it is adequate. Don't go into it expecting more than what it is capable of giving and you will be satisfied.

We find ourselves in the beginning at a nursing home with the elderly Jacob Jankowski's.  When the circus comes to town We begin to find out that Jacobs memory is still there and he takes you back to an era in the Great Depression.As a young man Jacob's life gets upended and he finds himself on a circus train.  They realize that Jacob with his training to become a vet will be of some use to the circus.  He falls victim to the ups and downs of life on the circus train and the beauty of the main act Marlena.  And falls in love with the larger than life Rosie, the Elephant.  Everything and everyone is subjected to the mercy of the cruel circus boss and Marlena's husband.This story is really engaging.  I personally found myself laughing at the antics of the circus family, cringing at the reality of the cruel act of red lighting.  And furious when the circus bosses cruelty reached horrifyingly to everyone and everything.

I found this book to be a very touching story with an interesting setting. The time period, the place, and the characters come to life in this wonderful story.  I don't want to give too much away but if you enjoy a book that makes you feel as though you are there...this is one!  There were times while reading this I wanted to throw a few punches, and other times I wanted to stand between August & Rosie, and times I just wanted to pat the hand of the older Jacob.  I'm sorry I finished this book...I will miss these characters.

If you have not yet read, Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen, you won't want to miss it. It's historical fiction that takes us back to the 1st Great Depression and into the world of the circus. A fantastic read and hard to put down.Caution however...chances are after reading this phenomenal historical account of the inner-workings of the circus; you may very well NEVER attend another one. I have had to set the book down several times due to how emotionally challenging it can be.Added bonus: The Kindle edition of this book includes historical photographs of circus life reprinted with permissions from various museums. I am unsure whether this is an eBook feature only or if these pictures are also included in the printed edition. I would imagine that they are. The photos alone tell their own story.My rating? (And I am, admittedly, a book-worm and literary 'snob' that takes these rating very seriously): 5 solid stars both for historical accuracy AND phenomenal character development, plot design and writing style. I don't give ratings that high unless novels REALLY shine and this one stands out and will forever leave it's imprint on you, the reader. Happy reading!

I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this book but was quickly drawn into the storyline.  As the daughter of an aging parent, I could empathize with the main character.  The story was developed well even with the flipping from the past to the current time.  At times I had a hard time putting the book down.  I had not seen the movie (but I will download it now) so the ending was a real surprise to me.  I enjoyed it immensely.

I really enjoyed this book!  I enjoyed the imagery of the circus and the settings, the historical facts of both the Great Depression and circuses during that time period, and I enjoyed learning more about circuses and the treatment of circus animals overall!There were parts that were disturbing - the mistreatment of circus animals, the mistreatment of circus employees, and the abuse of the lead woman.  But, overall, the plot was engaging and unique.  I especially enjoyed the flashback moments of the present lead character and his reminiscence of the past.  Make sure to read the Prologue! - it adds to the artistic nature of the writing style.I haven't seen the movie yet - hope it's as good as the book.

From August 2009:I'm still working out how I feel about this book. It was so well written, goes seamlessly between the past and the present. The love story (was it between he and Marlena or he and Rosie?) was lyrically written. The author did an amazing job of pulling me back and forth between the two. I even shed a few tears over a few different things. I'm not an animal activist, but certain parts of this book made me very uncomfortable. The history of the circus is pretty well known. We know the animals were mistreated (heck, they are today too), but the author writes so well about this subject that I found it hard to swallow that lump in my throat. It's obvious she did some major research into the subject matter.When I originally read the description for this book, it was on my "skip it" list, but a few of my friends read it and told me I "had" to read it. I'm so glad they did. This was a beautiful book and definitely in my top 10 for the year.=======================February 2010:I read this one just six months ago but someone in my book club chose it so I decided to re-read it. It's always interesting when I read a book a second time, especially if it was one that I really enjoyed (and this was definitely a book I enjoyed immensely.I noticed things I didn't notice in the first read, probably because I knew what was going to happen so I found a lot of the little quirky foreshadowing and things. The prologue, of course, caught me and a lot of "ahhh..." moments.This is a book you must read. It really is that simple. I had looked at it a few times, but it really didn't look like anything I would want to read, so I kept skipping it. A friend of mine insisted I read it last year and I'm glad she did. It's absolutely wonderful! Read it.

This book is very enjoyable from beginning to end. It starts with a narration in the present and weaves in events from the narrators past. The style is fluid and non pretentious, engaging for its simplicity and character development. This book feels real when it presents its characters and you can't help but get entwined with the sentiments they live. I haven't seen the movie but I'm glad I read the book first. The story revolves around Jakob a retired circus vet which relates how he came to be involved in the circus world of the 30's and all he lived through while the show went on. The story depicts life through the depression, prohibition and society as a fitting background for the storyline.

Wow.  This book was just spectacular.  I tore through it (it grabbed me and would not let go).  How many books do you see a fifteen-year-old (my niece) reading while walking up stairs?  She could not stop reading it to climb the stairs!  It was an amazing ride.  I cannot imagine that ANYONE would not love this book.I read two of Sara Gruen's earlier books and this is in a different category - a tour de force, an absolute must-read.  What a lovely book.  You end up feeling grateful to her for writing it just so you could read it.  I cannot say enough about how great this book was - an enthralling story, enthrallingly told, absolutely marvelous.

I purchased this book reluctantly, since it didn't sound like my "cup of tea".  I mainly wanted to read it before I saw the movie, which is the order I like to do this, especially when I can see the movie and then refer back to the book to refresh my memory.  But in spite of myself, I enjoyed the book very much, and read it into the late hours last night(and early morning) because I didn't want to go to sleep until I finished it!I like the way the author goes back and forth in time; it is well done and easy to follow - sometimes this device can get confusing if not properly handled!  I'm not much of a circus person; of course I went when I was a child, then again with children and grandchildren, but I had a fear of animals that has been only partially conquered thanks to my grandson's love of them.  I have always stood in the back of crowds at Mardi Gras parades due to my major fear of horses!  But this book to me was enough about the human side as to make the circus details palatable, even interesting.I especially enjoyed the story line at the "retirement community" since I have a good friend who works at one, and I used to advertise for the place when I had a radio talk show called "Life Begins at 50".  Needless to say, I am a senior myself and without giving away too much information, I felt that the scenes there were very real.  I would highly recommend this book, especially to seniors and their families - not only for the enjoyment, but for the relationship insights therein.

This book reminded me of the movie, &#34;Benjamin Button&#34;.  The format of an old man looking back at his life was reminiscent of the regretful and poignant tone in the movie.The story is told by Jacob, half about his life now as a 90-year old man, forgotten by his family in a nursing home.  The other half is about Jacob's life as a young man in the circus.  Jacob runs off to join the circus, literally, when he is just about to graduate from college.  Devastated by the loss of his family and fortune, he turns to the only thing he knows and loves--the one connection he has to his veterinarian father--the animals.  Jacob gets a job 'watering the elephants', and one grouchy elephant in particular, as he works as the circus animal veterinarian.  Jacob also has the really dumb luck of falling for Marlena, a trick horse rider.  Marlena just happens to be married to the circus boss, a sadistic man who beats her and the elephants.  The whole situation is a powder keg waiting to explode.Interspersed with this is the story of present-day Jacob and his longing, so tender and sad, that pulls on the heartstrings.  It is a sweet, tragic romance.I loved the parts that explained how the traveling carnivals worked.  It was so fascinating knowing that many incidents were based on real, actual events.  A heavy book with lots of good ingredients that will leave you satisfied.

When Jacob Jankowski's parents died in an automobile accident, he was just about to become a Veterinarian.But, with that shock, and the shock of finding out that his parents didn't leave him the financial comforts that he had thought were there, Jacob, didn't take his last college exam.  And, he wondered into the life of a circus, where he learned a great deal about the human condition and about animals.During these tough Depression Era days, he lived in filth, but the animals meant a great deal to him.  So, he applied what he had learned at Cornell University Veterinarian School, to protect the animals, and anyone who he loved.This book was a story about love, loss and finding what matters most to you, when you've loss what seemed to be all that mattered.

For the most part this was a moving and fascinating story. Well written, the characters were vivid and appealing, even, at times, the villains. However, I found the way the story ended to be somewhat trite and not at all believable.Although the loyalty and brotherhood among circus people was clearly portrayed throughout, the end of the story reduced this excellent portrait of a mysterious and esoteric world into a fairy-tale. For me, the lovely flight ended with a thud, from a delicious learning experience to an insult to my intelligence.

I had no anticipation of what to expect when I began reading Water for Elephants.  The most enlightening aspect of the story was the education I received about the hierarchy of employees within the circus.  From an outsider who has always been taught (but never believed it) that people in the circus where of lower class than others, I had no idea there were different ranks of people within the circus.  Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane.  From the beginning the book was colorful with characters.  The transitioning between the past and the present with the main character was an interesting transition.I try to approach a book with an open mind and throw other opinions out the window.  I am pleased I have done this because the people that I know who have read this book have ranged from horrible to excellent.  I found this book entertaining and engrossing. It was never a book that I just could not put down, but I enjoyed read it.  Because the era in which the reference of the circus occurred the comparison of food lines and the great depression was evident.  Although the inhumane treatment of the people and animals undoubtedly occurred during this time period, it wasn't easy to read it.  Although the hierarchy of the class of people was evident within the circus, it was not unlike how society actually was during this time period.  The author clearly did research to solidly base the sad realities of the treatment of people and animals during the depression era.The author weaved a story with vivid characters and animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light.  Sara Gruen's engaging "Water for Elephants" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life. Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero. "Water for Elephants" is a triumph -- of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.After all of this being said, I am on the fence as to whether this book lives up to all the buzzes and even deserving of being made a movie.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.  I do not regret reading this book, I only wish it was more engrossing.

No, I won't forget WATER FOR ELEPHANTS any time soon. The prologue is one of the best I've read in a long time. I actually called a friend and ready it to her out loud. The characters, in particular, Rosie the elephant and Jacob are accurate and tender, each in their own sometimes sad and poignant way. This book is a summer hit for a reason--it's an enjoyable read filled with the peculiarities of circus life that intrigue and woo all who are drawn to such a menagerie known as the "Greatest Show on Earth." ~Carol D.

I loved this book. I loved the circus atmosphere and the story. It was exceptionally well-written, and I enjoyed every page.We have a vet student joining a circus, with mistreated animals he's frantically trying to save and protect. We have a lovable elephant. The narrator is an old man looking back, and he recounts his tale in the immediacy of present tense as he describes situations that happened decades earlier. Interesting, and very effective choice, to write in present tense throughout.The ONLY thing that keeps me from giving the book five stars was the lack of character development for Marlena. Throughout the story I understood the protagonist loved her, but she seemed to be the woman tied to the railroad tracks throughout - Nell being constantly tormented by Snidely Whiplash - and I never really got a sense of her as a person. Maybe I missed it (not surprising - I read the book in daily spurts while I walked a treadmill), but I didn't even know how old she was. I got a much clearer picture of minor characters, like Rosemary, Kinko and Camel, than I ever did of her.I also never understood the whole "water for elephants" thing that the protagonist railed about in the beginning of the book. Perhaps it was something else I missed.Nevertheless, I loved the book, I loved the ending, and I know I'll go back to read it again.

Well, I spent 30 minutes writing a thorough review for one of the best books I've read in a long time, and--it's been three days--and it's not showing up.  I can't recreate what took so long to write, so I'll just say...this book is woooonderful.  I hated for it to end.

Reading a good book is a chance to run off with the circus--to escape into a fun and exciting world totally unlike one's own. This is Gruen's gift to her readers. I got completely absorbed in the double stories of the old man in assisted living and the young man in the circus. By starting her book with the reflections of an old person looking back, this novel reminded me of Evening as well as Snow Flower and the Secret Fan. The black-and-white photos add a lot too. The historic photo on page 70 of the so-called gentleman "freak" is shocking, isn't it? A fast-paced enjoyable book.--Carol Weston, author of Melanie Martin novels for children and teen advice booksGirltalk Fourth Edition: All the Stuff Your Sister Never Told You.

A wonderful story!  If nothing else this is an insight into the aging process.  As a child growing up in the 40's my dad took me to  watch the set up of Ringling Brother's Circus when it came to town and we went back that night to watch the teardown.  I never saw a show until I was 12 years old and worked watering horses for my pass into the show.  I remember getting to hold a very small tiger cub that had been recently born.  It was a thrill I will never forget.  So very glad that a friend told me to read &#34;Water for Elephants&#34;.  I am sure that I will reread it again in the future.  Buy it!  You won't be sorry if you remember the circus coming to town!

As I've started to branch out to reading a different type of book, Water for Elephants caught my eye, so I had to pick it up. I am so glad that I did! The setting was so raw and gritty and having it based on the history of circuses made it that much more fascinating. Sara Gruen was able to describe things so that I could easily picture the settings and all the circus workers. I just hope that the movie lives up to the book!

Water for Elephants is a compelling story told from the memory of a ninety-one (or ninety-three)year-old man named Jacob Jankowski. The story begins as Jacob prepares to sit for his veterinary exams at Cornell University. He receives word that his parents have been killed in a car accident and things go downhill from there. He ends up as part of a circus and the next three-and-a-half months are mostly a living hell, except for Marlena.The story goes back and forth between the present time in the "assisted-living" home where Jacob resides and his memories of the past. His children/grandchildren/great grandchildren take turns visiting him, but first-born son, Simon, misses the most important day of all. In the end, this misstep creates for Jacob, and the reader, a most satisfying end to a moving and heartwarming life story. (A bonus in this book is what the reader learns about circus life in the early part of the 20th century, most of which is pretty nasty.)As I care for my aged mother in her home, I am very grateful that we have been able to keep her here. This book provides a perspective from the viewpoint of the very elderly, who, while not as quick on all fronts as they once were, are still thinking, feeling beings.Carolyn Rowe Hill

I loved the first 90% of this book.  Whenever I opened it to read, I fell right into circus life in the 1930s, as told by the 93-year-old main character looking back on his life of 70 years previous.  My complaint is that the ending seemed rushed and contrived.  There were lose ends that didn't make sense.  For all of the reality of the first part of the book, the end seemed too fantastic.  Did the editor say "Wrap it up all ready!"?  I think this would make a TERRIFIC movie--just wait for the rights to be sold.  A good summer read, too.

I don't care what the reviews say, I thought Water for Elephants was a great read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Jacob's stories, both in the past and in the present, were extremely well written. I found his innocence and charm as a young man quite enchanting. Wouldn't it be grand if all young men were as courteous and as sweet as the young Jacob Jankowski? I also really liked the crotchety 90-year old Jacob, whose temper tantrums and emotional outbursts were most certainly justified. The loss of independence is something that we all fear, even more so when a person has lived a long and full life only to be left alone in a senior's home to die.I also thought Marlena's character was well-written. Divorce in the 1920s and 1930s was unheard of, and I can only imagine how awful it must have been for a woman to realize that she had to endure the rest of her life with someone she despised. I found myself wondering when she was going to make the decision to live for herself, rather than do what everyone expected her to do. Then again, she had already made that decision once by leaving her family, so I expected that she would come to the right decision at some point.As for Gruen's research into circus life during the Depression, I think that she did a fantastic job. America during the Great Depression is such a fascinating piece of history, and when you add the excitement of an all-American circus show to the mix, it becomes ever more so. All in all, Water for Elephants was a great read and I will be sure to recommend it to my family and friends.

Jacob Jankowski is 93 years old, but don't let his age fool you:  He's still sharp as a tack.  He lives in an assisted living facility, where he's forced to eat food he doesn't like and socialize with residents who are younger, but far worse off, than himself.  As he faces the realities of his advanced age and begins to deal with the ravages of time on his body, Jacob reflects on his younger years, when he worked as a veterinarian for a traveleing circus known as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  He joins the circus at 23, at the height of the Great Depression, right after his parents are killed in a car accident and right before he graduates from veterinary school.Most of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is written in flashback, taking readers back to Jacob's beautiful and strange years with the circus during the 1920s and '30s.  While working for the circus, Jacob falls in love with two girls:  Marlena, the circus's star performer, and Rosie, a bull elephant no one else seems to want.  But there are complications, of course:  Marlena's husband, August, is the "equestrian director" of the circus--and he's also very possessive, obsessive, unpredictable, and cruel, not past beating both his wife and his animals if they don't adhere to his commands.  But Jacob's love for Marlena and Rosie transcends all this, and it will change his life; he has no way of knowing how much. Now, as an old man near the end of it all, trapped in a body he doesn't recognize, Jacob clings to his memories, to the vestiges of his younger years, as if they are a life raft.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of Jacob Jankowski's life--gritty, surreal, full of vibrance and love. In her third novel, Sara Gruen brings to life a dazzling cast of characters in a vivid landscape little-explored in contemporary fiction.  The world she has created for her readers is, well, otherworldly:  magical and strange and startlingly real.  Her Depression-era train circus resounds with authenticity; she borrows anecdotes from her research and uses circus slang to add a sense of immediacy to the experience. Her prose is simple and unpretentious, poetic in its own way.  Simply put:  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is just lovely!I can't say anything bad about WATER FOR ELEPHANTS; I think it deserves every bit of praise it receives.  Jacob is such a compelling character, so utterly well-drawn.  His vibrancy as a young man jumps off the page at you; so does his frustration with being trapped in a withering body as an old man.  Gruen's tale moves back and forth in time seamlessly, and it's obvious how much she cares about her characters--even the non-human ones.  Her love story is impeccably researched, alternately heartbreaking and hopeful, romantic and violent. And the ending?--it's absolutely perfect.  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS took me somewhere no other piece of fiction ever has--and I can honestly say I enjoyed every page of the journey.

This book surprised me.  I usually don't read the summaries on the book jackets because I find that it spoils the story for me and so I didn't really know what to expect from this book.  However, by the end of the book, I was thoroughly fulfilled.  I loved the author's insight into seeing things from the perspective of the "90 or 93 yo" main character.  I found I couldn't put the book down once started.  I also liked the Q&A commentary at the back of the book telling how the author researched circus life - especially the story about Rosie - to include in the novel.  Great storytelling!

I couldn't put this book down. I have seen the awards it won, but never thought about getting it, I wondered who this Sara Gruen is, never read her books. SO I didn't go out of my way to pick it up. Somebody brought it in to work. We have a bookshelf full of books that we share. I saw it and thought, OK, now I am going to read that, it is here, I keep seeing it, I am taking the plunge!How wonderful. I was completely and totally into the book after reading the first 4-5 pages. I couldn't put it down. I loved it, this isn't my type of book normally. However, it is a great read. I felt like I was standing next to the big top through the whole book. Get it, read it and enjoy it, that is the purpose of this book.

** spoiler alert ** Before I picked this much talked about book, particularly since the film came out, I heard from a few friends that they couldn't read it because of the animal abuse. When I thought that's what the book was about, I actually didn't want to read it either not because I care so much but because I'm not quite as impassioned on the topic. It's not that I'm heartless or ignorant of that. It's just that I don't need to read anything about that topic to make me "feel" the injustice. But, with the hype and since I love to compare books to film, I figured I had to read it before I saw the film with Edward...ahem I mean Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. So, I did and immediately I was drawn in. I enjoyed how the narrative sliced between present day retirement home and past circus life. I appreciated the difficulties and heartaches of dealing with old age and time passing, with loneliness and loss of certain freedoms, with death. Of course, I also loved how the two main characters grew, fell in love, and fought against the obstacles to be together.It actually reminded me of Sparks' The Notebook. So, if you liked that and you like the circus, this is definitely the read for you. And for those animal rights activists, I didn't find the scenes of animal abuse that offensive. That topic is definitely a character in the book and certainly touched upon vividly BUT it's not accepted as just fact. It's shown for just what it is...horrendous...and that seems to make it more palatable. So, I would encourage the read anyway.

Take a chance and read this book.  It is wonderfully written.  Such an interesting book to take the lead character and having him in a nursing home, thinking of his life... and what a great life.  What a heart warming story.  I'm fascinated by the freakish carnivale life, and this didn't disappoint (but uphold) that theory!  If you're in for an uplifting tale of struggle and happiness in an unexpected way, you've found the perfect all-around book.  Enjoy!

Everyone was talking about it last summer, and my book club decided to read it. I was very disappointed. Characters were not believable, there was too much cruelty to animals and violence here, nobody I really liked except the dwarf, and the back and forth from the young man to the nursing home got very dreary. I skipped a lot of pages because the early part was so boring.

I loved this book. I'd been hearing so much about it prior to the film that I decided I had to read it. No one had really told me what the book was about so I was more than pleasantly surprised at the subject matter. I have always had an interest in the Great Depression and riding the Circus Train during that time period with Jacob was one of the best trips of my life. Sara Gruen's writing is descriptive and made me feel like I was actually involved in the lives of her characters. It was an easy read but a cause for dismay when it ended. I wanted it to go on and on. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who just enjoys a good story.

I could not help but notice that reading Sarah Gruen's Water For Elephants is very much like watching the movie "Titanic."  First and foremost, each offers big historic pageantry, with a rousing "you are there" quality.  Each features two parallel narratives from the same protagonist, one in advanced age, one in a defining passage in young adulthood.  Both feature a romantic triangle involving a young woman who is a victim of her times stuck in a marriage or engagement to a cruel powerful man and the young man of no means who becomes her soulmate and savior.  Both send the young man to a fancy dress dinner in a borrowed tux. Both create insular worlds that are set apart from the rest of the earth, one by an ocean, the other by the train-bound peripatetic exotica of circus life, and within that insular world there is a class structure inspiring social commentary.  Both the Titanic creators and Gruen took admirable artistic risks in going to material that nobody else was treating and both did their homework on historical detail.Water For Elephants is about circus life in the early years of the Great Depression.  It successfully captures glimpses of the American experience and opens up the closed world of the circus that is at once a very dangerous place and a warm sanctuary.  Gruen does not spare the gritty reality of disregard for human and animal life.  She succeeds in creating a very delicately balanced community that can slide into disaster if shoved off balance.  Thinking on the living conditions she portrays, sometimes you have to ask, why would anyone stick with this mess?  For the narrator, Jacob Jankowski, it is love for animals, friends and the aforementioned girl.Water For Elephants is, like the Titanic, a large scale entertainment but when it comes down to it, there is no one line or character that is surprising (except perhaps for the elephant).  The book is well crafted but not artistic.  It may have been very different in the hands of John Steinbeck or EL Doctorow.  That said, Gruen gets points for following through on her inspiration and delivering a book that is very atmospheric and historically interesting, with some social commentary mixed in.This edition comes with a worthwhile interview with Gruen and a book club discussion guide that is more like a junior high English class test.

Sara Gruen delivers a readable tale that's a tad too formulaic to be fully engaging. In the same way that the narrator of the story insists from personal experience that it is impossible to carry enough water to slake an elephant's thirst, I'd insist that this container doesn't hold enough water to satisfy a serious reader.Also noted: the description of animals and animal behaviors is approximately cartoony, and takes away from the whole.On the flip side, it is an easy read that won't occupy more than an evening and Gruen does offer up some fascinating historical details about old-style railroad circuses, which altogether comes off as plausibly true.

Frankly, all of the good things have been said about this book by other reviewers. I can only thank Public Radio that had a review of it. Otherwise I would not have heard of it.One of the things that the book points out is how tough life was during the depression.  American today have no concept of what it was like for people who earned no money, had no money, and had no place to go. There were no homeless shelters, no social security.  It was a different world.Gruen does a great job of showing the read the America of the Depression years and also tells a wonderful story.

The prologue to this book put me off a little, containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence, but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me.  Two more very ugly, explicit and disgusting sexualized "scenes" in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further.  I'm told this has been made into a movie, which not only beggars belief, but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching.

Purchased book based on reviews and I am a firm believer of reading a book before viewing the movie. The author does a great job of transporting you to this era and what it actually like to be apart of a great circus traveling by train. The author gives very detailed and explicit images of the scenery, animals, costumes and characters.However there are not smooth transitions from character to character due to the main character telling the story as an older man and hid younger self. It was hard sometimes to distinguish the difference between characters so much so I had to go back and re-read a page an then be like oh okay this is so and so.***SPOILER ALERT BELOW***I didn't care for the ending of this book either. I didn't think that it was realistic for the main character to leave his nursing home without aide (since in the story he can barely make it from the table to the window). Also he can barely button 3 buttons on his shirt, so how is he going to sell tickets at the booth to the circus? He meets a young man and he just volunteers to take care of him for the rest of his life (and he's 93)? This young man that he meets is no relation to him, it's just really hard foe me to believe that a young man running a traveling circus would take this all on.

From the other reviews, i was expecting to have my socks knocked off as I had in "The Glass Castle" by Jeannette Walls and "Replay" by Ken Grimwood, but instead I found that I was pleasantly entertained. No more. No less. The most impressive parts of this book were Sara's portrayal of the elderly. I imagine that life for the elderly is pretty much as she portrays it, which I found enlightening and interesting. These parts ended up being my favorite! The rest of the book is colorful, imaginative, and worthwhile.

Very well written and and very grabbing. There were, however, 2 raunchy parts that were a little graphic, especially since they didn't really effect the whole story much. These moments felt as if they were elaborated on specifically in to draw in a larger audience via random moments of smut. For me, it cheapened an otherwise 5 star book. Really now, that was an image of a cartoon character that I did not want inside my head!LIke I said. Beautifully written--but I would have preferred if the aforementioned parts were briefly stated so you knew they happened and then moved on [like the rape scenes in Khaled Hosseini's book (Kite runner, or even the marital scenes in 1000 splendid suns) ].

When I picked up this book, I was not sure what to expect. The first few pages hooked me and it was all I could do not to put the book down til the very last page. I spent a season with the blue unit of Ringling Brothers back in the 80s and even though the life has changed a great deal from the circus trains during the depression, the lifesytle is quite similiar. The different cliques, the constant travel schedule and life on the road. I remember many a nights sitting with other "joeys" and talking with the oldtimers who told similiar tales as in Water for Elephants.  My thanks to Sara for bringing back some great memories of my own circus career and putting a great story to such a facinating and unknown part of history for many people.  I do wish she had gone a little deeper into some of the other acts and aspects of circus life, but maybe there is another novel about life on the Ringling circuit. Loved the ending - so appropriate. Have recommended this book to all my friends and if you are looking for a thriling, dramatic read, this book is for you. Does not matter if you are not into circus life, this is so much more. It is about living, learning, trying to be the best you can be and never giving up. 5 stars - would give it more, but 5 is all that Amazon allows. Those who give this book 1 and 2 stars have no idea what they are talking about - have you read the book?

I'm usually drawn to books written about the depression era, as I have heard so much about it from my parents.  This book is not only that, but a great insight to the circus life during that time.  I had a hard time putting this book down in the evenings (after a day at work), and it was good timing that my spouse was out of town for the week.  Very well written, a great story, and a page turner. I'll be buying copies for future gifts.

Enjoyed the unique look at circus life in that time.  Also, the author had a very good understanding of, not only the process of aging, but how a person experiencing it thinks and feels!  The ending was surprising and pleasant, but not really realistic.

Loved this book.  It portrays the life of survival of humans and animals alike.  It has always amazed me how elephants put up with us ignorant humans and our slow mentality in catching on as to how to treat them according to their abilities. The fact that elephants haven't done away with all evil handlers is a testament to the amazing personality, patience and attitude of their creation. The circus realm has a lot of shame, guilt and blame placed at its feet. Even though this is a fictional story, the real stories of circus elephants is much worse and a hard read.  I'm looking forward to another place in time where all will live in peace with all living things as this great earth was intended.

This book kept me up past midnight this morning; it was the selection for our book discussion group this afternoon.  Each person in our group rated it a 5, which generally means the book was so good we couldn't put it down.I qualified my vote by saying I would give it a 5 for the author's work in researching her material and in linking Jacob's 90 or 93-year old self to his younger self along with her use of dreams and/or daydreams.The book was a page-turner as another member of our group had told me.  It arrived from amazon.com on Tuesday after I finally decided to pay full price for it since I was not finding a really good buy for a used copy elsewhere online.I am generally a slow reader, wanting to picture each event in my mind before I continue.  However, the book went pretty fast since it has a lot of dialog.One thing our book discussion group questioned.  How could Jacob be so sure that Mr. McGuinty could not have carried water for the elephants?  Couldn't he have been one of a number of boys who carried buckets of water to the elephants?  The author did not explain this.We saw some similarities to the Jacob in the Bible, but perhaps we missed some which the author included.  My Bible tells me that the name Jacob means "deceiver" so in what way were we deceived by him?  Were the last two chapters factual, or were they daydreams which came to Jacob as he sat in his wheelchair?

Water for Elephants is one of my all-time favorite books.  I read it in one sitting on a plane and then on an airport bus.  I was captivated the whole time.  I enjoyed it so much that I later checked out the audio version from the library and enjoyed it just as much, if not more.  Definitely worth a read for anyone who likes elephants, circuses, veterinarians, period fiction (Depression Era), or just good books in general.

This is a very interesting and well-told story which kept my attention all the way through. I only gave it four stars because even though I liked the book a lot, I probably wouldn't recommend it to others because there were several sexual situations that were somewhat graphic.

I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this book. I purchased it a while ago, thinking it was going to be the next read in my book club. That didn't happen and I actually forgot I had it on my Kindle.Truth be told, I waffled between 4 and 5 stars. Here's why...**Spoilers**Although flashing back between old Jacob and young Jacob ended up necessary for the reader to get the whole story, it was a bit annoying to me at first. Well, really, for most of the book. It wasn't that I didn't enjoy the old Jacob parts, they were very well written. The young Jacob parts were so well written, the change from one perspective to the other often threw me out of the story. I would be reading along, really into the story. Bam! Now we're back in the nursing home. It really distracted me. I even noted, about the third time this happened, that there better be a reason for the back and forth or I would look at it as a crutch the author felt she had to use. I still don't feel it was totally necessary to have old Jacob, but it was nice to have the closure that point of view was able to give us.Regardless, I will be recommending this book to all the readers I know. Not so much for the romance, to me that was a side story, but for the relationships Jacob had with the rest of the characters.

Though I am an avid reader and read hundreds of books a year, this is the first time I have felt the need to review a fiction book for Amazon.  There are very few books that I read that I will always remember or possibly even read again but this is one of them.  I read and enjoyed Gruen's other two books "Riding Lessons" and "Flying Changes" but was overwhelmed by "Water for Elephants".  I liked the fact that the past is being recalled by a 90 (possibly 93) year old man - you don't find many books that have an elderly protaganist and it was refreshing.  I enjoyed the many animals in the story - Rosie and Bobo especially.  I enjoyed learning about the traveling circuses and felt that Gruen really did do a wonderful job researching this book (I think the old circus photos added a nice touch, too).  The story fit together seamlessly and I was disappointed when it ended - I would have liked to read about the married years in more depth.  The ending surprised and delighted me. This was a great "feel good" book.

I was captivated by this book. The bits of historical data mixed with fiction made the story seem more authentic.The tale is told by a 93-year-old man in a nursing home. His recollections lend to the authenticity of this story. At first, it seemed like this had been a real relative of the author. When I realized that it was not, I was amazed with the author's creativity.

The book is a good book but in no way great.  The descriptions of the time period and the circus was great but the story was predictable to excess.  The characters were contrived and stereotypical.  I did enjoy parts of the story but it is not a great novel, it is merely an entertaining read.

Set in the Great Depression, this is the story of the spectacle of The Big Top. It will put both its hands around the heart and touch that heart in just about every conceivable way a heart can be affected.It has a motley cast of characters -- curiosities with two and four legs, animal lovers and haters, humanitarians and saddists, an absolutely unforgettable Elephant (Capital E) named Rosie, plus the irascible, irreverent, bellicose, and lovable narrator named Jacob.The writing is first-class, the crafting is painstaking, the characters are compelling, the pathos, laughter, joy, and soul is addicting. Such an emptiness after finishing this wonderful work. Highly, highly recommended, especially for animal lovers!! (And for this Chicago person, it was an added delight to know the locations in Chicago that added to this story.)Word to the wise: this work touches on some of the dark side of the circus -- some, but not all -- so go inside with the eyes wide open. As an animal lover, this side is the one that grinds my bones to powder. And yet, only a small bit of the dark was given -- more could have been added, but was not.The post script is just a personal observation and strong affirmation ~ that henceforth there will be no more Big Tops, Rodeos, Dog Fights, Animal Races, Bull Fights, or any other cruelties that will be offered as "entertainment" for humanity. Where is the humanity in any one of those events???

It's the early 1920s. Jacob Jankowski is about to finish up his veterinary degree at Cornell University when he learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash. Stunned by this awful and sudden turn of events, Jacob completely blanks while taking his final exams. He walks out and wanders out of town in a complete daze, eventually jumping a train. It turns out he has jumped the circus train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob pretty much instantly falls for Marlena, one of the star performers. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the animal manager, who is, as we come to find out, a paranoid schizophrenic with erratic behavior problems. The story focuses on these three characters as the circus train makes its way around the country, performing in various cities. Along the way, the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob befriends his reluctant roommate, and tries to save an ailing friend from being tossed from the circus.This is a really interesting and moving book. It's really fascinating to read about daily circus life and how things worked. And it's a touching story about a smart elephant, a compassionate vet, and a forbidden love. I do wish there had been some more charater development for Rosie the elephant, though. Also, the story is told in retrospect, from a present-day Jacob who is now in his 90s. Every few chapters, the story skips back to present day, and the nursing home-bound narrator. I felt the story would have worked a lot better if it had just stuck to the circus part of the story. The present day interjections were distracting. Other than that, this was an excellent book. Highly recommended.

I listened to the audiobook version of this book (great production!) but was one of those who was somewhat disappointed. I had read the glowing reviews and thought I'd give it a try. I listened to it all and thought the characters were wonderful but the plot was so slow. I felt like there were so many opportunities that the author had with the themes, time period, etc.that were not used. I give it three stars but there are so many other good books out there worth the 11 hours of time.

Can a stint of a few months in a circus change a boy's life forever? Yawn. The novel is peopled with cut-outs: a diligent country boy orphaned the day before his final exams; an ethereally beautiful horse-tamer with a secret problem (a loutish husband); perverted dwarves; whores with golden hearts; etc. Retold from a retirement home, the novel seems prepped for cinematic treatment, and doesn't linger in literature. It hurtles towards a pre-ordained resolution: the match made in heaven, in the book, and a movie contract for the author. Boo.

Fantastic read.  I flew straight through it in just a few intense sessions, eyes locked to the page over an hour at a time.  Couple of quick book comparisons immediately come to mind.  First, I'm reminded of the great line near the beginning of "Life of Pi", that informs the reader that they are about to hear a story that will make them believe in God.  I wrapped myself around that line and read in hopes of the book keeping that promise.  It's a bold promise, so I reward the book for its effort, but I'm not sure it lead to any true converts.  We get a similar sentiment in the beginning of "Water for Elephants."  Jacob pulls us in by insinuating that he's about to tell us a secret he's kept for over seventy years.  Again, I found myself lured into the book's "Big Top" to find that secret.  And much like an old-world carnival, I found my main attraction and enjoyed all of the book's turns and sideshows.Another book comparison that comes to mind is with "Iron Weed," a Pulitzer Prize winner in the eighties.  Like, "Iron Weed," this book does really an excellent job of submersing you in the feel and sense of being flat broke and in dire straights, trying to negotiate survival during the Great Depression. During a long stretch inside the world the book creates, I could literally feel the dust and dirt being kicked up by the roustabouts and workers, as the tents went up.  Gruen took my into those crammed, dirty box cars, and murky late-night binges.  I was there.One more favorite from the book.  The author somehow manages to make the internal world of a ninety or ninety-three year old man, trapped and forgotten in a nursing home, just about as interesting as the glitz and glamor of the show and the drama it unfolds.  That's no easy feat, but she does it well.  I was left thinking about aging, long after I had let go of the circus.  Jacob's thoughts about how senility sort of creeps in and his explanations of his two worlds, and no longer being sure where one ends and the other begins, stayed with me.  An excellent, excellent book.Chris BowenAuthor of,Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom

Water for Elephants has its good moments (a particular incident late in the book, during which the protagonist is standing over a sleeping but dangerous man with knife in hand trying to decide what to do next is hauntingly poignant), but all told, I'm glad that I read this book through the Kindle leasing program rather than buying it.There are several themes in Water for Elephants, including the lack of dignity often associated with the treatment of the elderly and the evil effects of greed. However, the backbone of the story seems to be a sort of iconoclasm. The Sterling images of the circus often inculcated in us during childhood are challenged by images of violence, animal cruelty, and graphic sexuality. However, the fact that this book unearths the dark side of the early twentieth century circus speaks less to its quality than to the fact that our society all too often allows commercialism and popular mythology to shape our images of the past. Simply challenging false notions held by society contributes very little to the value of a story like this one. In the end, the tone of the book takes on moods which can change violently from the darkly cynical to the unrealistically optimistic (the ending of the book feels impossible, illegal, and unsafe). Sentimentality, rather than a meaningful exploration of human emotion, dominates the scenes of the assisted living facility, although as noted above, the fact that those scenes also bring to light the continuing need for respect to the elderly does serve to redeem them to a decent extent.The story is, on some level, a "forbidden romance", and on this level, it has many failings. The rapidity with which Marlena falls for Jacob seems more indicative of a woman torn by the violent nature of her relationship than a woman in anything approaching love. The way in which August is killed seems to do nothing but Grant a legitimacy to the relationship via Pacidermis ex Machina, and to tie up loose ends.All in all, this isn't an awful book, but it seems to be the type of story commonly found in book discussion groups for all of two months before being rapidly forgotten. There is no real draw, beyond a handful of tense and well-written moments in the last quarter of the story.For the Kindle edition, images work surprisingly well, and I have no real complaints about formatting.

Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants will probably top the list for the books I read in 2010 (3 months left, so come on authors, wow me!).  It is evident that Gruen painstakingly researched life in the 1930's circuis, and her hard work paid off with a nice slice of Americana.  The book's plot kept me turning pages late into the night.Others have complained about the book's vulgarity, and I'll admit that several scenes were a bit too vulgar for my taste, but the subject is the depression-era circus, not nursery school.  While not necessarily pleasant, it was probably befitting the subject matter.The greatest praise I'll give Gruen was in her ending.  The fiction-literature authors of the last decade seem to be of the notion that a depressing ending makes for good literature.  I would like to remind these authors that I read fiction as an escape from reality, not as a desire to have more of it.  To Gruen's credit, she reached for the best ending possible, and she nailed it!  I hope the rest of her books are as good as this one!

I loved this book - there are a few naysayers in the sea of positive reviews and there is a reason for this.  It is an excellent book - of course it is not air tight but it is a fun read and interesting.  It reminded me in some way of the White City book in that it took history, in this case of the circus in a certain time period in history, and wove a story around this history.  It took me a little less then two days to read it and well worth the story!ooking for a fun fast read with a great story line - buy and enjoy this book!

I did not like the many sexual content, yet I do realize in some way to make this entirely a realistic book one has to have some of that.  I particularly did not care for circus performance of the LADY ...  But what I did like was the beginning of the story of the nursing home.  I truly felt sorry for the H and It truly made me want to visit the elderly.

Not that I wanted to know anything about the circus - ever - let alone the circus during the 30s, but there you have it. I read this for a book club; I'd never have chosen it for myself and was the only person to not enjoy the book. While I skimmed much of the circus part, I found myself enjoying the here-and-now part with Jacob in the nursing home.He was the type of character I enjoy, with his ornery comments and the loss he endured. Not necessarily with the death of his beloved wife, but with the forgetfulness of his surviving family, his children and grandchildren. It was almost as if he was an afterthought once he was in the Home - out of sight out of mind. That was heartbreaking, and I could see why he chose the end he did - to run away and spend the last bit of his life doing something he could, where people needed him and wouldn't forget him.The young Jacob's life - eh. He was weak, not very bright and I question how he managed to get into an Ivy League school. But then they don't test you on common sense. There was no real consequence for his actions in the circus, and he managed (drunk death defying feats on a moving train notwithstanding) to consistently escape his actions.I admit to not guessing the entire ending, though it was obvious who his wife was since her introduction. The writing was full of flowery clich&eacute;s, and there were several places I wish Ms. Gruen would've gone over again to plug up some holes and take out excessive details, but overall it did work. I just wasn't interested in it.

"Water for Elephants" by Sara Gruen is a well written, depression-era book, that most readers ages 15-95 could read and enjoy even if you think this isn't the typical type of book you would read.This book tells two stories simultaneously as a 93 yr. old crumudgeon embittered by his surroundings in a retirement home recollects his life as he travelled with a second-rate circus while falling in love with a married woman.I probably would have never read this book had it not been for a family book club (Isn't that why you have them), however I'm sure glad I did, I really did enjoy this read and found the pages turned much quicker than I anticipated.I always am interested to see how an author can write in the point-of-view pf the opposite sex and I thought it was executed wonderfully. Also, the terminology that was used was very specific to the time and to how the circus-folk spoke at the time. One could tell Gruen definately did her homework.If there is any drawback it would be the end to one of the stories (I'm not going to say which one or how it ends don't worry). I thought it ended kind of sappy and a little unbeleivable for a story that seems very factual.Bottom line, four stars. I am very stingy with my stars, so please read and enjoy.

I admire the author's work to provide the research to make this story not only horrifying at times, but also has an interest in this era of our history. There were many times I felt that it was difficult to put it down - definitely worth reading...

The author did a great job developing the characters and the story.  I didn't know much about circus life and the story gives the reader a good glimpse of what it was like.  Because I'm an animal lover, I liked how the main character looked out for well being of the circus animals.I recommend this book.

This was a book club assignment, I had not wanted to read this book because I had heard that there was some animal cruelty but as a member I try to appreciate other peoples book choices as they do mine.The cruelty was a little hard to read, especially the beatings of Rosie but I also found myself cringing at the unneccessary sex scenes that were over the top, boredom at the constant threat of tossing people of the train and disbelief at the stampede of the menagerie.I did like the elderly Jacob and his life at the nursing home, I think it shows how elderly people are often "put on the shelf" when they become a bother in life...so sad.  Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable.

THIS book was stunning in detail and takes the reader into the 'Big Top' in such detail that you can almost smell the peanuts! It contains violence but it is told with such skill that the reader understands just how brutal humans can be ....but the main character is the hero and does make a difference . As for the romance...its innocent and well written. There is something for all in this story and I see now why it was made into a movie. I have not seen it yet but I can only imagine !

It takes you back to an age of innocence in your life where the Circus was pretty close to the best thing that ever happened to you.  The elephants and the brave ladies that rode on them.  The clowns and the ittle people.  I enjoyed recreating those memories while reading this delightful and sweet account of two circus runaways who fall in love.  Their story was predictable in so many ways.  The old Jacob part was just sad and it left a sour feeling.  However, I did enjoy reading about the circus people and their lives.  The parades and the drama behind the curtain.  The roustabouts working so hard and sleeping in crowded spaces,yet what an adventure! to travel around the country from town to town brining smiles to millions and enjoying the camradie of the circus!  I loved that part.

This novel is a wonderful mix of fantasy and reality, pathos and joy!  With the sad tale of Jacob unfolding in the first chapter, the reader is quickly engaged in the story.  The inter-chapters weave the tale from the past into the present and make the reader empathize with Jacob and become endeared to the Circus and its workers.I read chapter 5 to my high school senior English class to give them insight into the life of an old man and his perspective on reminiscence and life.  They loved it!  They even gained new perspective on the elderly that they work with at their community service sites.What a good book!  I recommend it to all ages.  It is fun and full of humanity.

This book was made into a good movie a couple of years ago.  I always recommend that you read the book before seeing the film and again, this is the case.  This is an intricate, dramatic love story, with twists that hold your attention.  An excellent read.

Who would ever guess that a story about a circus would be so fantastic? The author, Sara Gruen, knew that's who.  Well, she was right. Jacob is lost after the death of his parents.  When he is just a final exam away from his veterinary license he stumbles upon a traveling circus train and inadvertently joins.  Through Jacob we get a glimpse behind the scenes of the the characters, relationships, struggles, and class warfare of circus folk.  Intertwined in this interesting story of the circus is a love story.  I noticed that one of the other reviewers found the love story a bit trite, but I disagree.  I found the love story completely believable and the use of flashback extremely effective.  Most importantly, I must tell you, I cried.  I RARELY cry while reading.  You are are going to dig this book!

Passion, hatred, love, and murder; Water for Elephants, the novel by Sara Gruen has it all. It's rare that I read a novel and become so engulfed with the story, but from the first page, I was hooked. The way in which Gruen has the protagonist of the story, Jacob Jankowski, switch back and forth between his 22-year-old self and present day 90 (or 93) year-old self is both creative and effective in capturing her readers. Every single scene has intensity and vibrancy. The juxtaposition of the elderly Jankowski and the young circus worker Jankowski posed a humorous yet almost sad setting for the story. Readers would be crazy not to fall in love with his character.Though fiction, the novel represents the lives of circus workers back in the 1920's and 1930's and gives insight to the gruesome conditions the men had to live in, and the constant struggles that they faced everyday. Each chapter begins with a photograph derived from circuses back from the time Jankowski would have worked. The photos truly show the lives that these men led and let readers see not only imagine how things were. Though the historical value of the novel was fascinating, the forbidden but passionate relationship between Marlena and Jacob was the most captivating portion. The constant secrecy from August and the fear of being revealed created an incredible emotional reaction for me.The corruption of the novel and the intensity of the characters made this novel a hard one to dislike. In my opinion, it has to be one of the best books written in the past few years. If there were one book I had to recommend to anyone, it would definitely have to be Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen.

I just finished listening to this audio book and I have to say it was truly wonderful.  I felt the circus come alive, great imagery and historic detail.  You could picture the circus`s shows with great detail.  I listened to this while commuting and found myself really enjoying my drive to and  from  work, traffic and all. The only negative was the sex.  My tween daughter really wanted to read this book because of the movie trailer but I had to say no right away after just the first chapter or so.  It really didn't add that much to the story and wasn't needed.

As I neared the end of this book, I was so sad. It was just such a wonderful, rich, charming story that I wanted it to continue forever!I was completely enchanted by Gruen's story and way with words. From page 1 of the prologue, she had captured my full attention with vivid imagery and intriguing characters. When you read great historical fiction like this, it's hard not to get sucked into the world and time of the characters. Water for Elephants does this to perfection--my mind was transported back to Depression-era America, as I traveled on a train-circus, mingling with performers and working-men alike. It was a fun and fantastical adventure.Gruen's story, gritty at times and uplifting at others, is compelling to say the least--I never wanted to set this book down! I thought the author's technique of transporting the reader back and forth between Jacob's time with the Benzini Brothers and his later years spent at the nursing home was done magnificently. And it was the his nursing home days that really made Jacob such a well-developed and likeable main character.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story! You will not be disappointed.

I didn't realize this book had been out for so long when I ordered it from Amazon.  Can't believe I hadn't heard of it before because it was a fantastic book I should have picked up sooner.  I think a movie is being made about the book, but I am glad I read the book first.  It's a quick read for a lazy Sunday afternoon. Definitely entertaining.  After I finished it, I felt like I was still transported back to the 1930's circus, and it took several hours to stop thinking about it.  Worth reading for sure.

Jacob Jankowski is ninety years old -- or maybe he's ninety-three; he doesn't remember.  However, he does remember a very interesting part of his life.  It comes about one day when the news that a circus is in town and one of Jacob's fellow nursing home inmates brags about having worked at a circus and giving water to the elephants.  Jacob knows the old man is full of it.  After all, Jacob once worked at a circus.  Rewind seventy-something years, to the 1930s, amid the Great Depression.  Jacob is twenty-three, just weeks away from getting his degree in Cornwall University to become a certified veterinarian.  Then he receives the news that his parents died in a terrible accident.  He also discovers that they had no money -- they had invested every last penny on Jacob's Ivy League education.  Distraught, Jacob runs away.  By accident, he ends up on a train, destination unknown.  He discovers that the train is actually one that carries a traveling circus.  One thing leads to another, and he ends up working as a sort of unofficial caretaker for the animals.  He meets August and his wife Marlena.  Jacob learns many secrets to life as a circus performer and worker, meets lots of interesting people, and encounters some very unsavory things.  August, for instance, is a very unstable, unpredictable person.  He is abusive to the animals and insufferable one moment, and completely charming and obliging the next.  The way he treats the animals, especially Rosie, the new performing elephant, makes Jacob sick, but he can't do anything about it.  The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth has its awful moments, but things get worse for Jacob when he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena...I like the way Water for Elephants changes from Jacob's present-day narrative as a cynical old man with early signs of dementia to his days as a nave young man and his struggles with wanting to fit into the Benzini Brothers and wanting to lose his virginity.  The way his voice and narrative change is clear and precise and you get drawn into this unique and at times quirky novel.  The backdrop of the Depression is wonderful and believable.  The secondary characters are compelling, especially Walter, August, Uncle Al and Marlena.  August is a horrible person, and the scenes centered on his abuse toward Rosie the elephant are indeed sickening.  It's a good thing Gruen spares us from too much information in terms of the actual abuse.  Rosie sounds adorable and I loved it when she was in the scenes.  I very much enjoyed Water for Elephants.  It's very moving and entertaining.  No wonder it became a #1 New York Times bestseller!  Even though the NYT list has never influenced my reading, especially since the stuff that makes the top list is mostly trash, it's nice to see that readers get it right every once in a while.  Sara Gruen is a great author.  I look forward to reading her future works.

This was a book that was hard to put down and I have recommended it to all my reader friends.  I loved the way it jumped between when he was a young man and now an older man.

I don't know why this book is on the best seller lists.  While the story is interesting, the writing is too one-dimensional.  The character development is elementary at best.  In my view, this book seems to have been written by a child.  It is so simple; it lacks depth.  What's up with the reading public?

My book club chose this book in the spring.  I decided not to read it at that time, despite the wonderful reviews.  Last week I picked it up to read while we were lounging at the cabin.  Wow!  What took me so long?This is one of the finest stories I've read in a long time.  It grabbed me in the beginning and pulled me through to the end.  It had a bit of everything---humor, adventure, romance, heartbreak.Water for Elephants is the story of a young man who accidentally joins a circus train in 1931.  Along with him we meet some wonderful characters---both human and animal.Spoiler Alert---I enjoy a story with a happy, yet satisfying ending.  This book did not disappoint.

The difficulty of writing a book that is a "good read" is that it must sweep you up and make you forget the world around you. You must become so invested in the daily life and fate of the characters that you become more interested in what is happening on the page than what is going on in your life. At its sporadic best, this novel is a good read. The author has chosen an interesting world and time to write about and obviously done her homework. But homework is not enough. The great nagging problems however are she is neither a good nor original writer. Consequently the characters she has created are wooden and every third sentence out of their mouths is either predictable or a howling cliche. The characters themselves are comprised of one cliche after the other-- the good hearted innocent hero, the evil boss, the plucky sidekick (a dwarf, no less),the bewitching damsel in distress, the schizo villain who is mean to animals... You've seen them all too many times before in books, movies, even cartoons. So when they meet their fates you shrug because you guessed what would happen to each of them fifty pages(or more) before. The book's huge success is similar to the success of a McDonald's hamburger-- you know what you're going to get as you walk into the place.

I feel a little weird writing a critical review about this book. It was strongly recommended to me by several people who said it was "a great story" so I was expecting something that would truly captivate me and pull me in. For me, it simply fell short.I think that a tremendous amount of time and effort went into the research involved for this book and that should not go unnoticed. If you're looking for a book that clearly depicts the Great Depression and/or circus life during that time period - by all means you should pick up the book. I do not know a tremendous amount about that time period to tell you if it was fully accurate, but I feel that it did give me a pretty good picture of what circus life would be like in that era. The photographs installed at the beginning of each chapter also did a great job connecting the story with the reality of traveling circuses of the time. The language probably could have corresponded a bit more, but in terms of the spirit and energy of the book versus the time period in which it takes place, I think it was pretty spot on.However, I really had trouble connecting with the characters. They simply did not seem like well-rounded, real people to me. I understand that the characters should be eccentric considering they are individuals traveling with a circus, but not to the point where they should seem artificial. Their emotional reactions to various tumultuous situations seemed unrealistic - based on having experienced similar situations in my life. The psychological repercussions would have been huge for a lot of the major conflicts that occur in the book - especially during the time of the Great Depression - but I did not feel the degree of inner struggle within the characters was well represented throughout the story. The characters would get sad or angry, but they seemed to sedate their feelings pretty darn quick.The depiction of the main character in his old age, however, seemed more realistic to me. I thought the scenes in the nursing home were very well done and true to life. The characters in these parts also seemed more believable to me. However, I was pretty disappointed in the ending. It seemed contrived. I will not get into it too deeply, however, so as not to spoil the story.I genuinely feel that Sara Gruen is a great author and did a good job with the book, I just feel that the character development was lacking. In terms of painting a picture of the environment though, she did a fantastic job and it's a book worth reading, if only for the descriptive element of it. Plus, tons of people simply LOVE the book - it just wasn't for me in the end.

At first glance, one might be inclined to think this circus novel an appropriate read for an adolescent audience.  However, parents may wish to read it first, as the novel contains overt sexuality and animal cruelty.That being said, both of the storylines are gripping.  The younger character experiences life in the circus as both cruel and rewarding.  The older character finds aging to be the same.

Sara Gruen's engaging novel "Water for Elephants" is a well researched and cleverly formatted reminiscence of one Jacob Jankowski, a 93 or 90 year old (he can't remember which) assisted living inhabitant.  Jankowski, still in possesion of his faculties, had worked in circuses for many years and this novel is a flashback to his life at that time.  Gruen spins her story alternating chapters of Jankowski's past and present.Jankowski had been an enthusiastic veterinary student at prestigious Cornell university.  Days before sitting for his final exams, he shockingly learns that his parents had been killed in an tragic auto accident.  To his dismay, he stunningly learns that due to the economic downturn of the Great Depression, his father's veterinary business and whole estate is essentially worthless.  His parents mortgaged everything to pay for his education.Distraught and penniless, Jankowski aimlessly wanders from the Cornell campus, eventually hitching a ride, hobo style on a train that was home to the Benzini Brothers circus.  Mentored by a alcoholic but kindly circus worker named Camel, he starts working caring for the animals in what was known as the menagerie.  He will assume the duties of a true vet and work under the schizophrenic equestrian director August.  Augie is married to celebrated equestrian performer Marlena, who Jankowski falls deeply in love with."Water for Elephants" is essentially a look back into the 3 1/2 months that Jankowski worked in the circus revealing the seamier underbelly of circus life from the side unseen by the "rubes"  or circus-goers.  The book concludes with the nonagenarian Jankowski once again fulfilling an improbable circus fantasy.

This book took me by surprise.  It seemed to drag a bit through the first few chapters, but then it got very interesting very quickly.  I was not a fan of the bad language, but the author really tries to put the reader in the rough circus setting and unfortunately, the circus is composed of less-than-polished people.  This book is full of action, and has a great romance story.  I loved the ending.  Minus the language and crudeness, I would give this book 5 out of 5.PS (I'VE HEARD THAT ROBERT PATTINSON WILL BE PLAYING JACOB JANKOWSKI IN THE MOVIE IN 2011!)

This book was an absolute delight to read.  Characters fleshed out enough to actually care about them and a well-researched insight into Depression-era circus life.As fare as plot goes, there's probably nothing you haven't already seen or read a hundred times over in romance novels, or Lifetime Network movies for TV.  Same material set against a new backdrop.Sometimes a good read is just that - a good read.  It doesn't have to be life-changing - just entertaining.  I love how it was all told as a personal history.I do appreciate the author's exhaustive research to get the circus terms right.  My only (small) complaint (and maybe I missed something) was that not all the terms were defined for the reader.  It does not take away from the storyline at all.

I hesitate to slap a derisive label like "chick lit" on anything, but author Sara Gruen's third novel is a prime example of the worst kind of "women's fiction"; Water for Elephants was obviously written by a woman solely for other women, with no attempt to be realistic from the male point of view. Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him "unshaven" with the implication that what he really means is "unclean," you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and "chick flicks" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a "twist" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, "Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it! Now downstake it!" [p. 34].(Yeah, that's what she said!)

I am unable to comment on all the details that made this book highly enjoyable, but nonetheless I wanted to add my review.One of the first things that piqued my interest was the fact that the main character was 93-years old (or was it 90?) which lent a different perspective to the storyline and resolution.  Jaocb, was a very likeable main character in his old age and in his youth, but was not the only character you felt invested in. The character of Walter (Kinko) with this dog Queenie was just as intriguing despite his secondary role in the story.  As well, the antagonist, August, was just as aptly developed, which made you fear his anger towards Marlena and Rosie.  Speaking of Rosie, as an animal-lover, I cared deeply for her safety and sucess in the future of the circus.I was surprised to find out that the author knew very little about the circus prior to writing this book, but she did an excellent job of researching to pull off a very believable background/setting for this story.The characters live with you long after the story is over and you find yourself wondering what happened to Mr. Jacob Jankowski as he started on a new adventure in his life at 93 (or was it 90?).

Gripping and suspenseful. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I love romantic stories that have struggles and this definitely fulfilled that want.

Amazing. The author really did her research for this book. When reading it, it was hard to put down. She went back and forth between present day and memories, which usually bothers me, but here it didn't. I found that I enjoyed both time periods. Everything was well told and really brought the images to life while reading. It was a very colorful read.

"Is where you're from the place you're leaving or where you have roots?"Jacob Jankowski is a young man, studying to be a vet at Cornell. When both of his parents die in a car accident, Jacob is so torn up, he runs away in the middle of his final exams and joins up on a circus train, the Benzini Brothers' Most Spectacular Show on Earth. His life in the Depression era on a traveling circus are intercut with the present day, 90-something year old Jacob reminiscing about the past and dealing with one of the most difficult obstacles: life.I Liked:With the movie due to appear in theaters soon and the recommendation from a friend, I decided to hunt down an audiobook and listen. And, in short, am I glad.Before I started reading, I thought (based on either the blurb on the back cover and the movie trailer) that the book was a love story dressed up in circus costumes in the vein of James Cameron's "Titanic". Poor boy meets wealthy attached (married) girl, both fall in love, blah, blah, blah. Throw in some random animals, circus acts, and there you go.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't the case. The characters were beautifully drawn and real, from our protagonist and narrator, Jacob, to his bunkmate, Kinko/Walter, to our love interest, Marlena, to our antagonist, Big Al. The story focuses more on the circus life than on the love between Marlena and Jacob. The setting was beautiful and intricate, the ambience was spectacular and grotesque (sometimes at the same time!), and I truly felt transported back into the past. Not to mention, there were many tearjerker moments--real, emotional moments, not those written just to elicit a pornographic emotional response.Jacob was a good narrator. I felt his pain as his parents died, I understood his awe at Rosie, I felt his disgust at August's disgusting behavior. But my favorite character was Marlena, and I can definitely see why Reese Witherspoon was cast as her. She is spunky, fun, mature, and spirited. My heart broke hearing how her family abandoned her just because she married a Jew (she was Catholic), and I hated how August treated her. Walter was also another great character. It was terrible how his mother basically sold him to the circus just because of his dwarfism. And the scene where he almost loses Queenie really brought home how alone and lonely this poor guy was.So many novels these days seem to be window dressing for a love story, but this novel isn't one of them. Sure, a cornerstone of the novel is about Marlena and Jacob, but there is much more going on. A man's journey into coping with death. The horrors of the circus. How hard life was back in the Depression. Escapism. The trials of growing older. The need to belong. The story deftly wove back and forth between younger and older Jacob, and I found myself interested in BOTH sides, not just one or the other.I Didn't Like:In places, the novel is very graphic. I didn't care for when Jacob barged in on someone AHEMing or hearing about the two ladies AHEMing Jacob.I would have liked to have seen a little more of the acts that went on in the circus, though I suppose those would work better in a visual medium.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:A few f-bombs, amongst milder profanities.Jacob is interested in losing his virginity. While drunk, two women try to perform sexual acts on him, but Jacob vomits on one. Two characters make love; "self love" is shown once or twice.The story opens with a character about to be impaled. Camel is crippled because of his drinking. August is abusive to his animals and to others. Workers have been thrown off the train, a practice called "red lighting".Overall:This is an impressive book, one that totally bucked all my prejudices and preconceived notions. It was able to do what a lot of books can't: make me care about the characters and take me to another "world". I only hope that the movie, when it comes out, can do it justice. Highly recommended.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*

I read both of Sara Gruen's previous books - primarily because they were horse stories.  I was really looking forward to her next book and was disappointed to see that it wasn't about horses at all.  It hit the best seller list and I read the reviews.  It didn't appeal to me at all.  I read more reviews.  Eh. Finally, I decided to read it.  I'm so glad I did!  This is one of those books that draws you in on the first page and doesn't let you go until the end.  I'm recommending this to everyone I know -and I'm recommending it to you.  Read it - you won't be sorry.

I really enjoyed this book - read it in 2 nights and in the end came away with a good feeling.  The insight into the old circus life was interesting & exciting.  The insight into how our elderly are treated was sad and eye opening.  Then in-between was woven love, adventure, friendship, animals, racism, murder, mystery, with a happy ending.  What more could you ask for?

Water for Elephants gives you a peek at the life of circus performers and the crew during a time when jobs were scarce in America. The characters in the story are as colorful on stage as off. This is a book that you won't want to put down as the circus train weaves in and out of towns with the array of likable and seedy characters.  And just when you think you know how the story will end--you will discover you were wrong.

If you read no other novel this year, make it this one.  This is perhaps the most extraordinary novel I've read in literally years, from an author with truly AWESOME talent.  Generally, I read almost nothing but mystery novels...and ones with "hard-bitten" heroes, at that...not even a hint of anything sniveling.  I'm just not a touchie-feelie kind of girl.  So if a feel-good book like this can affect me so enormously, just think what it'll do for those of you who like this kind of stuff!  Only partly joking here; but truly, this is one magnificent work of literary art.  Inside glimpses of life in a 1930's circus are so intimately written and ring so true, that it's hard to believe Ms. Gruen isn't 90 years old, writing memoirs.  Each character is so artfully rendered that you care, and care deeply!, about every single one of them.  You love them or hate them, with equal measures of intensity.  Add the super special treat at the beginning of most chapters of real photos from these old circuses, and you have just a jewel of a book.  Obviously, I'm drooling all over myself in this review, but I can't recommend it strongly enough, to everyone, no matter your preferences in reading material.  I took a chance and am SO glad I did.  Oh, and Ms. Gruen has a sense of humor too!  There are parts of the book where I guarantee you will be unable to hold back from a big belly laugh, right out loud.  Please, get this book.  You will NOT regret a single minute of reading time.  I fully intend to go now and buy every book she's every written, hoping for another glimpse of her genius.

I decided to read this book because I was looking for something different and I did find that.  I thought it was well written and it was a very quick read but I have to say that for me it was not a four or five star read.  The characters were interesting, and Rosie was great!!  A fun read but not all it was built up to be for me.

My two best friends and I are all avid readers, although we usually read very different books. One of them got it, loved it and gave it to me, and this book was passed around for several months. We had a mother in law, an ex boyfriend all reading it, which really speaks to how good the book is.You can read the other reviews to find out what its about...I'm telling you, you will be hooked instantly. Clear your schedule. This isn't a book you want to start reading when its going to be a week before you can pick it up again.

In a way I've already imagined what it would be like as a movie- because the author uses such rich imagedry you feel like you're at the circus with Jacob and Marlena. It's really a facinating book- GO OUT AND BUY IT!!!!

Water for Elephants is an awesome story about an engaging character that had me sneaking my kindle out at work to read a bit more.I loved it from start to finish. Some have criticized the amalgamation of the Jacob story from the Bible and post depression circuses but it works beautifully.The level of detail and insight into the train circus world shows an incredible amount of research but one of the most amazing things is none of those details come across as research. They are as natural to the story as the characters.

Not being, even remotely, a Robert Pattinson fan and not liking circuses either, I put off reading this book for several months after it was purchased.  I still couldn't help visualizing Robert Pattinson as the lead character, but eventually, the story took over and Robert faded a little.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really liked the book.  Well written, good story line and a bit of a surprise ending.  Still won't watch the movie (that Robert thing again) but the book is always better anyway.

Yes, this story reads like a script and I was interested in the characters.....however I thought the terrible things that happen was just too much.  Reading about the terrible things that happen to animals, the perverted things that carnies do, it was just too much - I wanted to erase that stuff from my brain the moment I read it.  That is just not entertaining to me at all.  I really did enjoy how the book tied "what happened" from the beginning to the end, very nicely.  That was very interesting to me and I'm glad I finished it.  I could do without all the other crap though.

What a delightful read!  Water for Elephants has got to be one of the best reads for anyone that likes animals, circuses, and a very wonderfully flowing story.  Working in or for a circus, especially in past years, had to be one of the most grueling and tough jobs to tackle.  Sara Gruen makes the reader smell the circus smells, taste the midway foods, and be in the ring with the animals as they entertain.  I have not been to a circus since I was a teenager, which is MANY years ago.  Water for Elephants took me back to those days reminding me of some of the things I saw and smelled.His family placed Jacob Jankowski in a home for old folks because none of them wanted to "have" to take care of him.  Sad, but true.  Jacob is not sure if he is ninety or ninety-three years of age.  He only knows his age is somewhere around that range.  Jacob hates the other old people in the home, hates the food, and hates the nurses that treat him like he does not know what he is doing or saying.  This is no life for Jacob Jankowski!The story then goes back to when Jacob was in Cornell College studying to be a veterinarian.  He was shy about women; wanted nothing to do with them socially.  Jacob thought he must be the worlds oldest male virgin.  Jacob does well with his schooling until one day he was called out of class and told that both of his parents had been killed in an automobile accident.  Jacob, of course, was crushed, mentally and physically.  This couldn't be happening to him.  His parents had been paying his way through college so he figured he could continue his education with whatever his parents left him.  His father was also a veterinarian with a good practice.  Jacob was beside himself when he was told that all the property his parents owned was being taken because of no funds to pay for the bills.  It turns out that his father bartered with his customers as they paid him in chickens, eggs, animals, or whatever they had, but not money.This upset Jacob so much that he just took off walking and walking until he came to a rail track that had a train moving that he was going to jump on regardless of where it was going.  Thus Jacob began his circus life when he jumped that train and met other circus performers and roustabouts.  He had no idea what lie ahead.  His inclusion into the circus life was difficult, as the circus does not like young rubes being around experienced circus people.  When they found out he was "almost" a veterinarian, they were elated, as they had no one to medically care for the animals.  This gave Jacob a ticket into circus life.As I said originally, the author makes you feel as though you were in the circus troupe as they raised their tents, did their shows, ate the food available, got paid when there was money, running away from the law when one or more in the circus caused a problem with the law or local authorities, traveled on the circus train never knowing for sure where they would end up, putting up with the circus owner and top management that treated most of the help like dirt.Of course there was much in the book about personal lives of the circus employees and owners.  Also how the circus obtained more animals and equipment legally or otherwise.  It is an eye opener for anyone to read.  It makes one wonder how these circus people existed in those days of traveling and living such an uncertain existence.The story does occasionally go back to Jacob in the home in which he is so unhappy.  The circus comes to town and sets up right next to the home, making Jacob so excited to be so close to the circus, even though it is not one of the ones he worked when younger.  The days passed so slowly as he waited for his family to come and take him to his big visit to the big top.I doubt anyone could read this book without coming away with a great understanding of those old circus days and what they meant to the people that worked that hard life.  You will know that Sara Gruen put much time and effort in her research for Water for Elephants.  You WILL enjoy this book.  It will entertain you and educate you at the same time.

Saw the movie before getting the book which I downloaded from Kindle.  Really liked the movie and then decided to buy the book.  The book is an easy read and if you ever have been to a circus or were curious about behind the scenes then you will probably enjoy the book. If you are looking for a deep mystery then this is probably not for you but if you like love stories and don't want to have to keep a notepad beside you to jot down things to remember so as not to get lost or confused in the story then this is the book for you.  I loved reading it on lazy days when I didn't have to concentrate real hard but could let my mind and imagination get lost in the characters and their telling of the story.  This Kindle book was downloaded immediately without any problems as usual.

This books was one of my favorites for the year. This book flashes from present day Jacob, 93 living in a nursing home to Jacob's summer traveling with the circus during the 1930's Depression era. Not only do you have these rich circus characters and animals, but also you have the interesting time period. The writing is flawless, the characters/animals (Rosie, my favorite) are amazing, the plot keeps you interested, and you root for the Jacob in the past and his present condition.The slight twist in the whodunit revealed near the end was also suprising

Although it is only April, I predict that Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen will be one of the best books I read this year.  Gruen has proven to be an amazing storyteller.Water for Elephants is told in the first person but from two different perspectives--Jacob Jankowski at 23 years of age and again, at 93 years old.  Gruen seamlessly weaves the chapters between past and present.  Jacob at 23 is finishing up his last semester at Cornell Veterinary School when a family tragedy causes him to flee.  He finds himself on a train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in 1931.  Needing a vet, the circus hires young Jacob to tend to their menagerie.  Jacob at 93 resides in a nursing home where he laments the curses of old age, the passing of his wife, and the waning affection of his family.  The arrival of a visiting circus triggers a flashback to his youthful circus experiences.1931 is a hard time for almost all Americans, and the circus workers are as hard hit as any.  Most are one step away from being homeless and jobless.  Conditions on the circus train are harsh for most.  Many workers go weeks without being paid, and they tend to disappear during the night when times are tough (management has them thrown off the train).  The menagerie is often times treated better than the workers.  But the circus does provide three meals a day and a place to sleep--even it if might mean a horse blanket on a train bed floor.  Jacob discovers very quickly that he's just about the only advocate the animals have and he must battle a ruthless owner (Uncle Al) and a crazy animal trainer (August).Any circus has more than their fair share of interesting characters, and Gruen's circus is no exception.  In addition to Uncle Al and August, there is Walter (the midget clown), Marlena (an equestrian with whom Jacob falls in love), and Grady and Camel (workers).  One of the most sympathetic characters in Water for Elephants is Rosie, the elephant--who shares more "human" characteristics and feelings than some of the circus bosses.  The tender-hearted Jacob quickly grows to manhood as he is forced to protect both animals and coworkers from abuse and worse.Water for Elephants is a delightful, moving book, and the ending was a very pleasant surprise.  Also, if you want a special treat, listen to it on audiobook.  The two readers, David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones, did a wonderful job of bringing both Jacobs (young and old) to life.

Sometimes, a reader's expectations can greatly influence how she or he views a book.  With a name like "Water for Elephants", and a historical background as interesting as the Great Depression, I had expected to read a book about the difficulties of the circus life and how the historical backdrop influenced these characters' lives.  What I got instead was a sentimental love story dressed in the glitz of a historical novel, a slightly better-written version of a Nicholas Sparks novel.At the start of the book, the circus has just come to town; and that effectively got our querulous 93-year-old narrator to start reminiscing about the good old days when he used to travel with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth as a veterinarian.  As it turned out, 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski was one exam away from getting his veterinarian's degree from Cornell when both of his parents were killed in an automobile accident.  After having handled all of his parents' affairs, and after having found out that he's now virtually penniless, the grief-stricken young man walked out of his class room and hopped on the first train that crossed his path, a train that turned out to be the circus train owned by a ruthless circus owner, Big Al.  For the next 3 1/2 months, Jacob travelled with the circus as a veterinarian, taking care of the animals in the manegerie during the day and traveling from city to city by night.  It was also during this time that he met Marlena, the cricus performer who turned out to be the love of his life, and her cruel but charismatic husband, August.  The three soon developed the kind of complicated relationship that any romance reader worth his/her salt will know how it's going to turn out.The greatest strenght of this book definitely lies in the author's portrayl of circus life as they were in the early 1930's.  With Big Al, August, and Walter the midget - the author has assembled a memorable cast of secondary characters that the readers will either love to hate or root for.  Walter, in particular, turns out to be a character with much more depth than initially meets the eye, and how his relationship with Jacob evolved and developed was one of the highlights of the book.  Equally interesting was Jacob's interactions with Rosie, a mischievous elephant that ended up being the catalyst for a key event that will change Jacob's life.  I've never been a fan of the circus, but reading about Rosie's antics made me want to grab a handful of peanuts and head to the zoo.Regrettably, our main protagonists in the featured love story aren't nearly as interesting as the secondary or even the animal characters in the book.  Jacob, in particular, has about as much personality as a gnat. Throughout the book, he was grouchy as a 93-year-old, and whiny and ineffectual as a 23-year-old.  Some of the atrocities committed against the members of the circus - all in the name of survival and profit - is heartbreaking.  And yet, other than to rant and spend time sulking and moping around in his stockcart, Jacob was useless when it comes to helping his friends or even taking fate into his own hands.  Ultimately, his life turned out the way he wanted it to not because of any initiative on his part, but pure luck.  Since the book was told in first person from Jacob's point of view, the character of Marlena was even more under-developed than Jacob.  All we know is that she's this beautiful girl in pink sequin that caught Jacob's eye the day he joined the circus and from then on he was lost. There certainly wasn't enough interaction between the two to make their romance remotely convincing.  And for a book whose central theme is the great forbidden romance between two people who met at the wrong time, this is a great failure.So, in summation, if you are expecting to read a meaty historical that provides insight to what the circus life was like back during the 1930's, skip the book.  If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks and looking for a sentimental love story to tide you over until his next publication, this may just be your cup of tea.

The story was good enough to keep you turning pages.  The reason I liked this book was the insight into the lonely world of nursing home patients that still have all their mental facilities.  It forced me to consider how senior generations (soon my parents, then myself) will deal with frailty, dignity & mortality.  Choices are thrust upon them by well meaning do-gooders.  Maybe we should allow seniors more slack to live the lives of THEIR choosing.  Either way, it aided me to see seniors with more compassion.

I have wanted to read Water for Elephants for some time but I needed to be in the correct frame of mind in the event there were too many disturbing animal stories. After learning my friend had a copy and my dad was currently reading it I decided it was time.This book as been billed as a love story within a circus however the love story does not really start until well after the half way point of the book, maybe even two-thirds of the way in. There are many stories happening all at once. The story of a lost boy trying to find his way, a coming of age story. The story of friendships and life long bonds. The story of an almost veterinarian finding his way in the crazy life of a train circus. And the story of love. With all these potential story lines happening at one time I found the author had a tendency to wrap them up rather simply by killing someone off leaving only the main characters to survive.While overall I did enjoy this book it was not as wonderfully fantastic as I was hoping it would be. Maybe my hopes were too high from all the rave reviews I have heard. But it just did not stand up to my expectations for this book. I will give the book 3.5 out of 5 stars. I would liked to have seen more depth to the characters, a more focused story line, and a bit more thought into how to wrap up the lives of some of the characters.

There were times I had to stop reading this book because it was so graphic.  I can't stand animal abuse of any kind, and I literally wanted to cry as the author described the treatment of the circus animals.  Some reviewers here have also been blasted for their criticism of the soft porn in this book, but it IS graphic and can be rather shocking.  I didn't expect this in the book at all and so as much as I wanted to like this book, I have my reservations about it.  Just be aware that there are some moments in Water for Elephants that are not for the squeamish or sensitive.

The audio C/D was EXCELLENT--use of different and well chosen voices for the younger and elderly Jacob telling a tale that spans 7 decades.The story was about LIFE and sudden curveballs thrown one's way, and the rewards/repercussions for making snap decisions at those snap moments.The background of the circus set in depression era America was a bonus.  I loved the multifaceted characters.  The author touched upon social problems that are eternal:social status based on wealth and education; physical differences/disabilities;domestic abuse;alcholism/homelessness;elderly dignity; elderly driving/vehicular manslaughter;loss and recovery of HOPE and LOVE.The character development was wonderful.  Walter was not "just a dwarf"  He had a mother who threw him away because he would not be a help on the family farm.  Walter, though bitter still had the capacity to love--amazing . . .I did enjoy the circus setting--learned much about things I never knew while listening to a lovely connected work of fiction.  (This was no Middlesex,my favorite book af the decade; yet, it is a fine, well-written saga.)

This was an unexpectedly wonderful book.  Witty, funny and exceptionally moving.  Who would have thought the circus is as bureaucratic and complicated as the corporate world!  The glimpse into life on a traveling circus was an enlightening and refreshing backdrop from which to catapult some of the themes we all face in our daily lives.  This book narrates the life of Jacob Janowski, an aspiring vet who is left orphaned and hops aboard what he soon learns is a train belonging to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth!This book is full of hearty laughs and painful disappointments. You will fall in love with Jacob's relentless can-do attitude and his inherent affection and commitment towards those he grows to love.  Rosie the elephant will touch you in ways you cannot imagine.  There is a certain depth around the love that animals exude.  It is silent and unspoken yet so powerful.  Rosie is intelligent and caring and through her vigilant eyes and silent actions is a magnificent portrayal of loyalty and friendship.  Walter the clown is another character to whom I grew very attached.  He is the typical insecure cynic whose interior consists of nothing but a soft shell.  He embodies the spirit of change and devotion and camaraderie.  This incredible cast of characters makes this a book of overwhelming depth.`Water for Elephants' was a surprisingly poignant story that is brimming with emotion.  The characters are so authentic; their memory will remain with you well after the pages of this book have ended.  It was a truly unique and enjoyable read.  Highly recommended.

I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to do so through tears most of the time. I really loved the way she wrote the story from both perspectives of Jacob as a young man and as an old man. It helped it mean more to me to read about it from his memory. It reminded me of what treasures we have in our elderly. I also loved to see all the old pictures, they were great. On the down side of the book there was more then needed sex and bad language in the story for me. But that's just me. I do like the book and am very glad I read it.

I read this book in a day. A day. I just sat and read and read and couldn't put it down.For those unfamiliar with the plot, Jacob Jankowski is 90. Or 93. He is living in an "assisted living" home. One day, the residents notice a circus going up near the home, and it brings back a flood of memories for Jacob. He unfolds for the reader the story of his time with the Benzini Brothers Circus in 1931; of how he met Marlena, Walter, Camel, and a cast of other characters, especially Rosie, who is one amazing elephant (I fell in love with her, too). It was an incredible ride, and I'm not sure how to summarize it better than that.Gruen's descriptions are so apt one can smell the animals, the popcorn, the sawdust, and the sweat. It's an incredible achievement. The entire spectacle is so vivid that you'll swear all the people contained in its pages are real and breathe, or did once. It's the kind of book that makes you forget you're reading a book and transports you to another time and place, and it's definitely earned a place on my favorites shelf.If you, like me, have waited to read this one, do yourself a favor and read it now.

I love books that make me feel the grit of sawdust between my teeth.  Sawdust?  Why, yes, if you're reading a circus murder mystery. Only, it isn't much of a mystery as you learn whodunnit on the second page.  Only, no, don't be so sure.  A lovely, you-are-there novel of the between-wars years in America, wherein one newly orphaned and penniless Jacob Jankowski runs away to join a down-at-the-heels circus whose owner has serious Ringling Brothers envy, complete with ladies fat and bearded, unfriendly dwarfs, and homicidal--wait, no, I'll give it away.  With an ending that made me smile all day after I finished the book.

Engrossing story. I love anything that takes me into a different world and holds me there and this story does that - the writing is simple, but the characters, the settings, the whole circus world is vividly portrayed. This book is always on my TR ( to recommend ) list when people are looking for a great, sweeping read dense with everything that makes a book memorable.

'Water for Elephants' provides an insiders peek behind the curtain of a traveling train circus. Anyone who ever went to a circus and played the games on the midway are rubes wanting to be thrilled, enchanted and take leave of reality for a day. The illusion lasts about as long as cloud of cotton candy. The inside story delves into the darker aspects of what makes the circus viable especially during the 1930's Depression era. The reader is introduced to a strict caste system from bosses to performers to roustabouts that determines one's position among a long train of characters. The practice of 'redlighting' is  particularly powerful, a Darwinian, survival of the fittest practice where the circus bosses have the used up roustabouts tossed from the train as excess baggage. Our hero is Jacob Jankowski that over the course of  only 3 1/2 months joins the circus. As a veternarian he does not fit into the caste system. Through his character we take a journey making allies with unlikely people, finding love and slaying personal deamons.

This book already has over 3,500 positive reviews on Amazon and every one of them is well deserved. This book was a wonderful treasure. I eargerly awaited each time in my day when my schedule allowed fiction reading so I could get back to this story. The characters are three dimensional, compelling, and as genuine as your next door neighbors or your long-lost aunts and uncles. The circus setting was fascinating, and the story-telling was first-rate, doesn't get much better than this. I highly recommend this book. I haven't seen the movie (yet), but if it's even half as good as the book it will be tremendous.

Water for Elephants is an engrossing story about life in an early 1930's, depression-era traveling circus, but is also about so much more. Jacob Jankowski is presently ninety or ninety-three (he doesn't recall) and living out the end of his life in a nursing home. He has family who visit, but they are busy enough with their own lives that he is largely forgotten. A circus comes to town and Jacob thinks back on his own youthful experiences.I appreciate the story's realistic portrayal of early 20th century circus life. The animals live and work in conditions that are horrific, but at the same time they are the lifeblood of the show next to the human performers and are therefore treated well enough to that extent. The author, Sara Gruen, mentions in an interview that many of the anecdotes in the tale are plucked from real life accounts. (For example, an elephant stealing lemonade from the lemonade stand when no one is looking.) Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed.

This story, about a young man who runs away to the circus, is beautiful in the way it paints an older man near the end of his life in a loving, endearing way. Older people are real people whose value is in no way diminished. In fact, they have lived their life and survived life's most difficult challenges. And yet despite all they've learned and know, they are given so little respect. Every day they courageously cope with challenges that most of us have never even come close to experiencing. Even their family often treats them callously, or worse, like little children. Some older folk are cranky, like the character in this story, but considering what they've been through, they deserve kindness in return, not defensiveness. The treatment of this older man by nurse Rosemary in this book has inspired me to love older people and respect them more.

I bought this book on the recommendation of my good friend and I absolutely fell in love with it. Sara Gruen is so articulate and a true story-teller. She weaves a mesmerizing tale of the magical and historical side of the behind the scenes of circus life. The deceit and downright meanness' gets transformed into this entertaining tale. The people and the elephant will linger in your memory long after you finish this story. A super read and I Highly recommend this novel.

I knew very little about this book before I read it. I didn't know quite what to expect; but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It certainly wasn't as good as The Kite Runner or other great books I've read (thus why I didn't give it five stars), but it was still a very good story. I would easily recommend it to others. The author creates a rather fantastic situation - a Cornell veterinary student who suddenly finds himself a penniless orphan during the Great Depression. The story takes us to a circus train, a love triangle, and an elephant. Gruen weaves a wonderful tale that I found captivating, told both in the present and the past. In the meantime, I learned a great deal about circus life in the 1930s.

WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is really two books rolled into one. The first involves a young, depression-era  veterinarian who loses his parents in a car accident just days before taking his final exams. His father, also a vet, had mortgaged his practice to the hilt to pay for his son's Cornell education. At loose ends the boy hooks up with a circus.The second has to do with the same man, now a miserable nonagenarian confined to a senior citizens home. He gets into a "fight" with another old man who claims to have carried water for the elephants. You don't carry water for the elephants; you take the elephant to the water. One would think the first story would be more compelling since the circus is a world of its own with its own language and culture, but it's really the ninety-year-old who wins our hearts. His "people" come to see him every weekend, but he doesn't really know who they are; he doesn't remember if he's ninety or ninety-three. But he does remember the circus.The circus story is kind of hokey. Almost immediately the young vet, Jacob Jankowski, falls in love with Marlena, the star of the equestrian act. The problem is she's already married to the animal trainer, who just happens to be a paranoid schizophrenic. He's also insanely jealous. Then there's the elephant, Rosie, who only speaks Polish; Camel, an alcoholic  roustabout who helps Jacob get a job with the circus; and Kinko, the dwarf, who at first is an enemy of Jacob's but later befriends him when Jacob cures Kinko's dog Queenie of the trots. The book does come to life periodically when Sara Gruen uses real circus lore. For instance, Uncle Al, the circus owner, loves freaks. He takes the circus train on a wild ride when he has a chance to employ Charles Mansfield-Livingston, a man with a parasite twin growing out of his chest, whom he calls Chaz.Gruen also provides numerous real-life circus pictures, one of which is especially titillating. She got them from STEP RIGHT THIS WAY: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDWARD J. KELTY and WILD, WEIRD, AND WONDERFUL: THE AMERICAN CIRCUS AS SEEN BY F.W. GLASIER.Gruen keeps you turning pages, relying on a couple of suspense elements. Does Jacob get the girl, and does Jacob, the nonagenarian, get to see a circus one last time?  I had a bit of a problem with Gruen's ending. I suppose it might appeal to the sentimentalists out there, but let's just say it's not exacting realistic or believable.

Not my usual cup of tea, this was a delightful novel, quickly read, with a great setting and entertaining characters.  There were actually two stories in one -- the first being an engaging tale of a distraught youth running away with the circus and finding his manhood, love and responsibility for others.  I found the narrative compelling and the characters worth caring about.The second story, embedded in the first (or is it the other way around) is that of an elderly man, growing weaker in body, who is still sharp enough to know that he's fading quickly.  His faculties are starting to have issues, but he, again, is smart and together enough to realize this as well.  His story of a strong, vibrant will trapped in a failing vehicle is incredibly poignant, and, if a writer were talented enough, could make for a captivating book on its own.The "easy", high-action story of the circus makes up most of the book, but is tempered very well by the internal musings and frustrations of the second.All in all, very satisfying and highly recommended.

Sara Gruen spoke about how her literary agent turned down Water for Elephants in the talk she gave last year for the Rosamond Gifford Lecture Series, the largest library related lecture series in the country sponsored by the Friends of the Central Library (Onondaga County System, Central New York). This was the second (or third ?) book she had done with that agent. She told the audience of 2,500 people that when she proposed the manuscript to the agent, the agent told her, "There's no market for books about circuses" and turned the book down. Sara's response, as I recall, was, "What books about circuses?" This got a big laugh from the audience most of whom had read Water for Elephants. All wannabe authors writing anything other than romance, historical fiction and vampires take note. There is hope for you.She is not only an outstanding writer, but also an engaging speaker. I personally enjoyed the book immensely although I was a little uncomfortable with the first person present point of view. She struggled a little with probability at the end but I especially liked the little illustrations liberally sprinkled throughout the book that she had obtained from the Ringling folks in Sarasota.

It might be difficult to find someone who has not read the book or seen the movie. After all, the book stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for over two years. So there is no shortage of opinions on the novel and the movie. I am not sure I have anything new to add, but I will offer my take on three of the most debated of the book vs. movie questions.Spoiler alert: Stop if you have not yet read the novel or seen the movie...The book: Uncle Al and August are two separate characters. The movie: The two are combined into August. Verdict: The movie got it right. Uncle Al is an under-developed character in the book. The movie gives us one villain who is more menacing, especially as portrayed by Christoph Waltz.The book: Marlena gets pregnant with Jacob's child. The movie: She does not. Verdict: The movie steered clear of the hackneyed device of having the woman in the pair of star-crossed lovers get pregnant.The book: We are taken back and forth in time from the present of the old Jacob to the past of the young Jacob. The movie: Scenes with Jacob as an old man bookend the story. Verdict: I have mixed feelings about this one. The passages focused on Jacob as an old man are poignant, insightful and empathetic. Some of the best storytelling on being old I have ever read. I would enjoy an entire book based on those passages. However, they interrupted the flow of the narrative and suspended the building tension of the story.

I want to preface this review by stating that I loved the story.  The characters are wonderful, the depiction of an old time Circus and the life of those who were "on the show" is impressive.The book has two major flaws, in my opinion.  First, the beginning of the book is a word for word copy of the most tense and climactic scene, and the entire novel is spent just knowing you're headed to that scene, so all the power of that moment is spoiled.  A linear telling of the tale, start to finish, would have been much better.I'm not sure what was gained (if anything) by the dual voices of young and old narrator, but I suspect it was done for "literary effect".  This is a very powerful tale of romance, the bonds between men and animals, passion, love - every time it shifts back to the present - it's like a deflating balloon.I wish the story had been told on it's own without the unnecessary shifting of voice and had actually had a climax remaining when the climax arrived...I recommend the book, but lament some of the choices the author made in presenting it.

"Water for Elephants" by Sara Gruen,  2006Ms. Gruen writes an odd story.  It is really two stories in one.  The main one is of an almost veterinarian, Jacob Jankowski, who becomes caught up in the life of a circus.  It is a romance: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back (whoopee).  In the afterword the author explains that she was wanting to do a story about the photographer of circus', but she got caught up in all the rest of the circus history and it became this book.  It is worthy and good.  The second is of the same man in a nursing home, or some such place, who sort of does not belong there.  He has lived his life and remembers it well.  The instigation is the circus has come to town!!The chapters are defined by when is the story being told.  Sometimes it is now: he is old and ornery; the next one, he is remembering his life in the circus.  The value is in the perspective: as an old man, he has problems, but he deals with them, somewhat; as a young man he grows up and finds the love of his life.  It is always wonderful to read a story of love growing and becoming the be all to end all.  But real love is of the animals, horses, elephants, orangutans, chimpanzees and doing something constructive.  In the end you feel that everything is wonderful and has come out all right.The odd thing, like in some other places I have seen ("Passenger 54"), the title comes from out of the blue, once, and it is never explained or spoken of again.

There were many positives about the story - 1)  Nice feel of what it was like to be in the circus during the depression  2) Great analysis of what it is like to be old in a rest home.  3)  Excellent voice characters for the audio.  4) Beginning of good bi-polar character.Negative - 1) Feel of the story moved from period piece about the circus to feel of Nazi camp where all leaders are evil  2) Instead of developing bi-polar character he was just written off as evil.  3) One big surprise in the book concerning the murder but not that monumental.  4) Three needless scenes that bordered on pornographic.

An amazingly beautiful story, Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants is the tale of Jacob Jankowski and the 3 months that he worked for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus. When we meet Jacob, he is in his 90s, living in a nursing home and reliving his days with the Benzini Brothers circus. It was through a chance encounter after the death of his parents that caused him to leave veterinary school and put his fate with the circus.I was really surprised by how quickly the story captured my attention. The novel jumps back and forth from "now," where we see Jacob dealing with the trials of old age, and "then," as he remembers his days with the Benzini Brothers circus, and how those days formed him into the man that he would grow to become. The sequences are fluid, though, and you find yourself easily swept along with the story. Sara Gruen's prose is amazing; I found myself on several occasions holding my breath, I was so wrapped up in the story. Gruen clearly portrays her characters emotions and captures each of their voices and personalities perfectly and her portrayal of the lives of the circus folk in the 1920s-30s was very grim. It was amazing to me that so many people would live that kind of life, but I guess when that was the only work to be had, they'd take what they could get.Gruen seems to have done her research as well. Even though the Benzini Brothers circus is fictitious, I think it was clearly influenced by any number of circus' in operation at the time. She also makes reference to several actual circus events (such as the Hartford Circus Fire of 1944 and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus train accident of 1918). Even down to the band playing "The Stars and Stripes Forever" during an emergency, Gruen seems to have done her homework on circus life.If you haven't read this yet, I'd really recommend it. I'd had the book on my shelf since it was released (I was caught up in the buzz, but never got around to actually reading it) and after 2 friends mentioned it a couple weeks back, I decided to take it off the shelf and give it a try. I'm sorry that it took me that long to get around to reading it.

"Water For Elephants" is a human story, filled with the drama of raw human living. The cover invites you to step right up and look at the shadow side. The title is a subject that the narrator, Jacob, knows far more about than anyone else, having spent years on a circus train. So even the title points to the in-your-face flavor of the story. The characters walk into the story from the rough years of the Great Depression. They all point to the darker side of our nature, while they put on a show that denies the fact. Here we find true grit: the smell of alcohol; the sight of blood; the sound of rage; the feelings of frustration.The plot includes people who grit their teeth and bear the pain. Jacob becomes addicted to his pain through the years. August struggles with mental illness. Marlena presses on in a marriage she doesn't want. A dwarf ekes out a difficult living in a world of rejection. The big boss pushes on to maintain that his world is composed of "suckers born every minute". The animals too also bear hardship and abuse from supposed caretakers.The story is energized by a foretaste of rebellion against the oppressive power. This early glimpse kept me moving through the whole story. Note that this is not a happy story. You're not going to read Winnie the Pooh. Sara Gruen finds a silver thread of redemption in the midst of dark clouds in Jacob, albeit a painful thread. It sticks like a tattoo through the years, making Jacob what he is in his nineties, still swinging his fists at enemies long gone. He is isolated, and to battle loneliness takes the only path at the end of the story that he knows.I guess all I wanted was a happier ending.

This wonderful book shot through the family like water through an elephant's trunk, as my father, my wife and I all read it in the space of two weeks. Gruen writes the most enjoyable kind of historical fiction, focused on a fascinating time and setting that the reader probably knew next to nothing about before starting the book. In this case, the scene is the American traveling circus of the early 1930's, just after the start of the Depression. The protagonist operates in two time periods, as a nonagenarian in a current day "assisted living facility" and flashing back to his days as a young veterinary student who due to circumstances beyond his control ends up serving as the vet for a traveling circus. Gruen intended to imagine various vignettes for the book, but in her research and interviews with circus veterans discovered stories from real life that were even better--a real-life case of truth being stranger than fiction. The assisted living facility is inevitably less interesting than the world of freaks and geeks in a circus, but Gruen handles the voice of the aged just as deftly as that of the young vet.  The book is enhanced by actual pictures from various circus archives. Not an especially profound book, "Water For Elephants" still gets a five-star rating for all readers for readability and Gruen's ability to evoke an interesting place and time so well, along with a surprising and touching, albeit a little far-fetched, ending.

Water for Elephants: A Novel by Sara Gruen was an outstandingly well-written story. It transports readers to the depression years where able-bodied men wandered the country aimlessly looking for work and taking any menial job offered so they could eat. In Gruen's novel, a traveling circus prayed on the desperation of these men, used them, and then discarded them. The men in charge of this circus treated their performers, both human and animal, with slightly more care as long as they attracted rubes ... the gullible public. The story is told through the eyes of Jacob Jankowski, a ninety-year old man committed to a nursing home by his grown, also-aging children. He delves into his memory bank when a circus sets up nearby. His recollections of being a vet with the traveling circus are vivid, poignant, and disturbing. So are the scenes of Jacob's life in the nursing home. Gruen skillfully interweaves tales from his past with the present. She probes our conscience about care for our elderly and our animals. Although the book is not for the squeamish, in the end, she gives us hope.For what it's worth...D. A. Welch

Following the main character in his twenties and in his nineties was very engaging. There were some points where scenes were brushed over, but they usually involved violence (to animals or people), so it's probably just as well. I loved listening to it rather than reading it, because it made it come alive.

Alright, so I saw the preview for the movie Water for Elephants. The movie preview looks great. To be honest, I read reviews about this book and I had considered buying it at the store for some time, but thought it was a read I could do without. However, I am one of those people that usually has to read the book before seeing the movie. Water for Elephants is not a book I will remember for a long time and will be telling my friends about. The story lacked a lot of oomph and I didn't care for all of the sex. I will be trusting my instincts on books after this. I mean, movies usually differ a lot from the novel anyway, right? I will give Water for Elephants this: it was sweet concerning the elderly. I have a soft spot for the elderly, they've lived a full life and I found myself more intrigued with the older Jacob Jankowski than the younger Jacob Jankowski. I also felt as though Water for Elephants wasn't finished in some areas. I like closure, unless it is a series, which this clearly is not a part of.

I loved this book from page one!  Obviously much research was done by the author, as the descriptions of circus life during the depression are very realistic, believable, mundane and exciting.  There were times I choked up, times I laughed out-loud and times I was simply entertained by the descriptions of aging.  Would highly recommend.  This was a book I did not want to put down, and was saddened when it ended...I wanted to continue reading about Jacob.

I won't try to tell you what this book is about....there are many other reviews here that can do that much better than I can....I just want to let you know how it made me feel.I had the miraculous privilege of growing up with all of our "ole folk".  Both sets  of my great-grandparents lived well into their 90's. For anyone who had this kind of wonder in their lives, you know what a blessing that was....and for those who didn't.....well my heart aches for your not knowing what you missed.  Watching and listening to; in particular, my Grand-dad E. was both heart breaking and fabulous!  His mind was sharp and exact till the end...even though sometimes his physical self didn't follow suit the way he thought it should.  Even with all of the frustration that came with getting older and losing control of parts of his life, he always had advice to give and stories to tell.  I would stay up at the barn with him all through the summer days, helping him work on his projects while he explained to me how to tell when a snake was venomous or showing me how to brush the horses out at the end of the day, because no matter how tired you where...they had worked harder.  I am filled with memories of sitting and listening to him telling tales of when he was in his 20's and 30's and what they all did to get by during the depression. He also made sure I knew how wonderful it was to get sit out in the field you'd been working in all day and eat your fill of the melons that were being harvested.  Reading this book was like sitting in that barn all of those years ago listening to this man that I love so much, tell me about a world that we can't even imagine while he showed me the right way to do things in the world that I lived in now.Reading this book was like spending those summers with my Grand-dad. Sara Gruen made me feel the train swaying as it ran through the night and let me smell the smell of the animals as they stood in the heat of the day waiting to be tended to.  She let me cry over the hardship of the lives that these poor men and women lived then let me feel the excitement of hearing the music start up for the shows.  She had my stomach aching for want of a bite to eat...to then have my mouth water when the flag finally went up over the cook tent.  Of all of the books that I've ever read, Water for Elephants, ranks high up in the ones that made me forget myself and drift into the world that had been put down in the pages.While pregnant with my oldest son, I helped care for my Grand-dad and as he had been an enthusiastic reader most of his life...when his eye sight began to fail I read to him.  I wish I'd had this book to read to him.  He would have been as lost to it's wonder as I have been these last two day..Mrs. Gruen....amazing.  Simply amazing.

After reading in book reviews (in the newspaper) that this was a good book, I bought the audio version, unabridged.It started slow, the character 93 years old.  I wondered if it would pick-up and it did--when the same character went back to being in college.  It took longer to set the stage than I expected, but the book kept me listening all the way to the end.  And even though I liked the younger character better--it was much more interesting than listening to the older character, it ended with the older gengleman.  It was a surprising unexpected ending, that made it all the more worthwhile for waiting for it.The setting was a seedy travelling circus set in the Depression era in the US.  Some parts were sad, the disposable people to the circus owners, and the treatment at times of the animals.  The reader brought it all together--the main character, and I truly enjoyed this book--not one I would normally be intersted in or buy.I might have been able to skim by the slow parts if the book were in paper form, not audio, or if the chapters were shorter in the audio book.  That was my only complaint in this book.  SOme things were drawn out too much.It was a sad happy story, but unlike Oprah's books, good prevailed overall and the majority of the time--in the story and in the ending.  It was a hard time for America and for the small time travelling circus, and those who lived that life.  It's a good read.  I might have enjoyed it more in hardback, then the 93-year old voice and pace would not have grated on me so much, or dragged so much, else I would give it a 4-star, but not 5--it has some slow parts that drag it out too much.

This novel is a rambling, disjointed and thoroughly annoying depiction of a highly forgettable era in Amercan history.  The characters are flimsy, the plot is circuitous and the endless stories of animal cruelty are downright depressing.  Perhaps the one saving grace is the author's use of Jacob's character as an elderly man who is looking back on his life with hindsight.  I cannot believe there has been such a fuss about this book and that someone was foolish enough to make it into a film.  Now that will be a real flop!  If I ever see this author's name again I will move away from it as quickly as I am able.  This was just a terrible book.

There are so many things to rave about when it comes to Sara Gruen's novel.First it's a period piece (which I love) set in Depression-Era America that gets all of the details just right: it's gritty, truthful, and unsentimental, yet still fascinating and entertaining. I was amazed and enlightened by all of the details of an early-20th century circus and all of its inner workings.Secondly, the novel is told from two different perspectives.  One is a 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski, who is an ivy-leage educated animal doc and recently "orphaned", while the other perspective is a  90(or 93)-year-old Jacob, whose days are spent in a nursing home, longing for the days of his youth.  Both perspectives are equally compelling and entertaining, and they come together to reveal mysteries about the story in the end.Speaking of mysteries, I loved that there was a twist that totally caught me off guard in the end.  These always make for great pleasures if done right, and Gruen's  surprise delivers a punch at the end that I wasn't even looking for.I already am waiting for the mention of film rights to this one.  It screams movie all the way through.  Not just because of the amazing story and characters, but also for the potentially incredible set design, costume design, and stunning visuals.  The elderly Jacob would be a great role for someone in the winter of their years and the flashbacks between then and now just yearns to be filmed.Finally, the characters in this book sold me.  Every one of them is a real treat.  As you might imagine, the characters in a circus are, well, real characters, and those from The Benzini Brothers circus is no exception.  Jacob, upon accidentally joining this troupe, discovers real evil, unlikely friendships, and the love of his life.  The characters are not exaggerations or caricatures like another unnamed circus novel I have read.  These people are empathetic, realistic, funny, and fascinating creations you won't soon forget.Get a copy of this novcl today. You'll be rooting for Jacob Jankowski all the way.

I just finished reading this and I expect it will be the best book of fiction that I read this year. I usually buy a book for Christmas each year for a friend and an elderly aunt. This is the book for 2007! My only disappointment is that Sara Gruen does not have a long list of other books for me to read. I also loved the photos that were at the beginning of the chapters. Sara Gruen is going to the top of the list of my favorite authors!!

There are endless ways to sing the praises of this novel of one man's surreal life in a circus.  Water for Elephants ranks as one of the top five books on my list of best and most shocking endings.  I just didn't see that ending coming.  I gasped when I learned the truth. Water for Elephants is a haunting story.

This book was thoroughly enjoyable. It was a bit edgy in parts and certainly gut wrenching in others- not unlike Grapes of Wrath in feel, but although well written it is not in the calibre of Steinbeck. On that note though one isn't always im a Steinbeck type of mood.  If you like pathos, uncertainty about how things will pan out and history without the whitewash- this is a book you will like. If you like a well written, crafted novel as well, you will love this.

Set in the Great Depression, Water for Elephants is a compelling tale, perfect for a book group discussion. Jacob Jankowski loses his parents in a car wreck and drops out of veterinary school. He finds his way aboard a circus train and begins a new life on the road. He meets and falls in love with both circus star, Marlena, who is married to the perverse animal trainer, August, and the seemingly unteachable elephant, Rosie.I was most taken by the circus details and the details from the Great Depression that Gruen used in the story. I was fascinated with life in the circus during those hard times. I also liked how Gruen moved the story back and forth in time from an elderly Jacob to a young Jacob.

Water for Elephants is the definitive  novel on love and compassion in the midst of unspeakable pain and despair. It is on my list of five best and most unexpected endings mainly for the secret that Jacob keeps his whole life.  There are so many incredible little secrets about life in this book just waiting to be discovered.  The plot is riveting.  It's an incredibly fast read and it is truly as magical as a circus.

At some points during this book I wondered why it had made so many year-end "best" lists.  Once I had finished it, I knew the answer.  Water for Elephants is the first book I've read in ages that was capably resolved and concluded.  The satisfying ending made the rest of the book begin to shimmer, and I found myself thinking about the main character and his way of relating with others long after I'd closed the book.

As much as I wanted to really like this book, I felt that it failed on several levels.  I will say that the circus atmosphere was conveyed with incredible, and apparently accurate, detail and I was impressed by that. I could see and even smell everything, and the book movingly conveyed how desperate times led to desperate people clinging to even the most degrading employment with a third rate circus.  However, the characters seemed to be straight out of a romance novel, with the exception of old(even he's not sure how old he is)Jacob, who was funny, disarming, feisty and touching -- whereas the young Jacob was pretty vanilla, too obviously a "nice guy" with little personality.  In contrast, Old Jacob's voice was so clear and true and I really cared about him;he was funny and sad, his memories bittersweet, his longings compelling.  I also liked (but who didn't?)Rosie the elephant, who had twice the personality of anyone else in the fleabag circus, with the exception perhaps of Walter, the dwarf.  The plot depended on coincidences that I had problems believing, and I found myself caring more about the animals (which I admit isn't unusual for me!) than I did about any of the people.  However, I'd heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sentimental stories, who loves happy, pat endings, who doesn't necessarily want a book to convey great ideas, but who is touched more by the romance rather than the writing.  Those of you will, as have many others, it appears, love this book.  There is certainly nothing wrong with that, it's just that those kinds of books are simply not what I prefer to read.  This book might actually make a good movie, and I'd be surprised if Hollywood hasn't snatched it up already.

I thought this was an interesting read until the author decided to label the villian of the piece as a paranoid schizophrenic.  August was cruel, sadistic and had violent mood swings.  None of these are symptoms of schizophrenia.  He did not hear voices, have complicated delusions, or an inability to keep touch with reality.  Unlike most unmedicated schizophenics, August had no trouble  thinking rationally or logically, on the contrary, he was in charge of a large section of the circus and exhibited fine organizational skills!The writer could simply have portrayed her character, August, as a jealous, violent man but instead she chose to advance the false stigma that people with schizophrenia are horribly cruel and violent or that they have a "split" personality. If only Gruen had researched psychiatry as well as she had the circus.I work with people who suffer from this disease.  While, without medication the patients delusions might possibly, rarely, lead them to do something violent, it's usually in relationship to fear associated with a delusion -- thinking a person is really an alien from outerspace, for example.  Never the sort of cold-blooded violence August engaged in.  August always knew exactly who or what he was hurting.When medicated, people with schizophrenia are actually less likely to commit violent acts than the general population.It's truly a shame when a popular book spreads stigma in this manner, the negative ripple effects go on and on.

I encouraged them to continue on and nobody was disappointed.I felt it was the best ending of any book I have EVER read.  When I got to the last few pages, I literally said out loud, "YES!  That's EXACTLY how this story should have ended".Don't pass this one up.  It is an excellent book.

This was a great story line, but I really get disgusted with the writers that think they have a free license to use the Lord's name in vain. It has become a disgusting passtime and all too prevalent &#34;thing to do&#34;.  And why do they do it? It adds nothing to the story. Just a disgusted feeling and sorrorful feeling for the author. It shows how the people of the world are falling away from God. That is one thing I miss with my Kindle, I always use a black marker and mark out that word from the sentences or stop reading the book altogether.

It's a NOVEL. I found nothing offensive - in fact, some situations were authentically told from the male perspective (by a female writer!).  A good summer read for me!

Water for Elephants  Algonquin Books, 2007, $8.37Sara Gruen  ISBN 1565125606I started taking steps, one foot at a time. My feet of course. The circus tent was getting closer, and I could hear the music. These are the words of Jacob Jakowski in the book water for elephants. Jacob was in veterinarian school, but before the final exam his parents were brutally killed in a car crash. As if that was not devastating enough, Jacob later found out that his parents had been accepting corn and other food items, and had put up a 2nd mortgage on their house just so he could through his final year in vet school. During his final exam, his hands were shaking, and he could not concentrate. He ran out of the room, and jumped onto a train that by chance belonged to the Beninzi Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth! His life is changed in an instant, and his world seems to be surrounded by good and evil.The book is based in the 1930s during the great depression A time. I would recommend this book for those who love realistic fiction. I have no doubt in my mind that this book is one of the best books of the year!-- Jace McBride

Ninety-three-year-old Jacob Jankowski, an unhappy resident of a nursing home, reminisces about his life with the traveling train circus -- Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth -- during the Great Depression. In and out of a small town, usually an overnight, the performers and working men put on a show that involves animals, freaks (the dwarf and the fat lady), the clowns, and all manner of circus act entertainment including a tent just for "gentlemen" and other delights.Jacob's parents died just as he was about to write his final exams in veterinary school at Cornell University. Because of the hard economic times, his parents mortgaged everything to pay his tuition and thus he was left grief-stricken AND penniless. He ends up joining the Benzini Brothers by an accident of good timing and, because of his vet training, he ends up hired on to care for the horses and other animals. Along the way, the circus owner purchases an elephant named Rosie; she becomes a special part of this story.Author Sara Gruen weaves a tale of hooking the rubes into coming to the show, second-rate performances that managed to wow the audiences, boozy nights, in-fighting among those with the train, backbreaking work, and other fascinating details of the traveling circus. Jacob quickly assimilates into the hard life and makes the mistake of falling in love with Marlena, one of the performers who has a sadistic husband. Not only cruel to his wife, August also beats and mistreats the animals. What will become of Jacob and the rest of the members of this group of misfits, outcasts, and showmen?Readers will savor the story and applaud the somewhat maudlin ending. I read it quickly and found it very sweet and entertaining; recommended for teens and adults. Enjoy!Caveat: there are descriptions of mistreatment and abuse of animals in this book. If that is unpalatable to you, you should skip this book.

No spoilersI picked up Water for Elephants on whim in the bookstore while waiting for another book to be mailed to me from an Amazon marketplace seller. It had been recommended to me both by Amazon and by people I know, but I never gave it much thought because I'm not really a fan of the circus, but having just finished it (in a day and half) I am very glad I picked it up.Others have summarized the book sufficiently, so I won't go there, but I will say that from the prologue to the last page, you are invested in this book and the characters and care what happens to them. The story is told by the main character in his nineties who is in a nursing home, looking back on his life and how he got to where he is. The prologue is of the climactic event in his life in the circus, and then the rest of the book alternates every few chapters between his first hand accounts in the present in the nursing home and his first hand accounts in the past as a youth in the circus. The scenes from the present in the nursing home force you to sympathize with a man whose body is old but who is mind is young and the struggles associated with such a circumstance, while the scenes from the past in the circus are a window into the past that show you who this man used to be.This book had a captivating beginning, and satisfying ending, but my only problem, and the singular reason I didn't give it five stars was that in the middle, the story was just a tad slow. However, don't let that discourage you from reading it because, as you can see from my title, that only warranted a half-star reduction from me because this really is a great read as a whole whether you love or hate the circus and I recommend it full-heartedly to lovers of a good story.PS: For a novel with a completely different plot, but with similar execution (telling the story by alternating between present and past) and a fantastic five-star story, try Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.

This is a wonderfully poignant book that slides seamlessly between the 90 Plus year old Jacob, and his remembrances of his youth when he was 23 and spent time with a traveling circus as its Veterinarian.  The frailities of Jacob who is now in the Nursing Home is portrayed so realistically that it almost seems like those parts of the story are actually written by an old person.  In counterpoint, the story of the younger Jacob's traveling circus adventures seems the same way, as if the author has actually experienced this lifestyle.  With twists and turns, heart melting moments of happiness, heart-wrenching moments of anger and sadness, this book is one that, once started, is hard to put down.  You'll be glad you chose this book to read.

One day I was surfing Amazon looking for a good read. There are times when I'm looking for something different that I just go with a good title. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised, other times I'm not. This was a pleasant surprise. I'd never heard of the book or the author so I came in on a clean slate. It was a wonderful read, one of those books you hate to put down for mundane things such as work and sleep. I was instantly hooked on the main character, Jake, and the life he led. Sad in spots, dark and violent in some places, bittersweet at times, it was one of those stories that pulled me right in and made it hard to say goodbye when it was over.

I am not real sure what I expected going into this book, more of a romance "chick" book I guess. I don't really like romance books all that much so it was awhile before I actually read this book but wishing now I had read it sooner! It was NOTHING like I thought it was going to be at all!This book is about a 93 year old man in a assistant living home that is recalling the time he spent in the circus as a young man after his parents got killed in a car accident. I was really expecting it to be more happy upbeat book about the circus but there was very little "happy" in this book! Some parts were so hard to read and I had to keep myself reading, not because the writing was bad or the book was bad but because some parts were just heart wrenching that it was hard to read without crying or at least on the verge of it, or wanting to go and kill August!The writing was amazing the author has amazing talents and I never expected the ending! I was actually fairly pissed off when Jacob didn't get to go to the circus and was thinking that I was going to be pretty upset with the ending but it caught me off guard and I ended the book smiling and crying at the same time.Amazing book read it!

I have read a bunch of novels recently that kept me engrossed for the first 70-80% and then faded badly. Water for Elephants is worth reading right to the satisfying ending. It is very well paced and has interesting twists and all the characters seemed real to me.I had never considered the 1930's touring circus as a basis for writing a novel. Now I want to learn more about it. That's because Gruen does such a nice job describing it. The characters (and the animals!) are very human and I think she captures the time they lived in quite well. I am impressed that there are over 1000 reviews and still more coming for a book that's been out now for over 4 years. It speaks to some of the universal qualities that appealed to me and perhaps other readers. The lead character is interesting, he's human and he has reflected on a life well lead while  yearning for more. I see a little bit of my father in there!One thing I am always looking for is how well a writer can give voice to a character that is so different from him or herself. Ms Gruen as a modern woman writing in the first person a man in the 1930's does very well in making Jacob a believable character. The writing is tight, swift and it was a pleasure to read.

I just finished reading Water for Elephants and I really enjoyed it. It's a love story and so much more. The author conjured up images so sharp and clear that I often thought of the classic movie The Greatest Show on Earth (directed by Cecil B. DeMille). The characters were well-fleshed and it was obvious from the beginning who was the 'hero' and who was the 'villain', both vying for the beautiful heroine. And then there was a secondary story set in present day that was artfully woven among the vintage circus story. I really enjoyed this book. The author did a fabulous job of drawing in the reader, and I found myself longing for bedtime (my reading time &lt;g>). I know this book has been optioned for a movie and I do hope the director does the book justice.

The Carnival life isn't easy.  Being chucked off the rails, the mistreatment of animals.  This story though, brings the Carnival life to life.  The ending was beautiful.  So masterfully done.  The book was so much better than the movie.  If you have not seen the movie (which by now I am sure you have), read the book, you feel each and every character like it were you.

For several years, various animal rights organizations have campaigned against circuses, citing the cruelty inflicted upon animals.  Gruen shows how cruelty permeated the institution.This is a wonderful novel about love and decadence, greed and control, and cruelty and tenderness.  It starts weakly, where the protagonist discovers his parents were killed in a freak traffic accident.  He hops a train, and winds up working for a circus.  But don't despair, I promise it's worth finishing.Gruen's characters are vividly drawn.  Hierarchies amongst performers, workers and management prevail.  Descriptions are so vivid, you can almost smell the hay, and everything else so accurately described.This is a wonderful window into life in a circus, with all it's horrors and despite them, it's draw.Well done!

First, as the title of my review implies I *did* enjoy this book, and I *would* recommend this book.In a nutshell, it was a good story, put together well, well told, easily read with a good ending.  Nothing wrong there, but that's as far as it takes the reader.To those of you going into this book expecting the next great american novel, or "the best book you ever read" as I have seen more than a few describe it in other reviews, um.. no.  Not even close.I think all the reviews and even the critics reviews have done this otherwise very good book an injustice.  You will not find wisdom in it's pages, nor will you laugh/cry/etc (at least I didn't).So, if you go into reading this book with the expectation of a good read, you won't be dissapointed.  If your looking for something special, I just didn't find it in this book.In the end, my criticism isn't with this book, but all the incorrect accolades poured upon it.

I love the novel, Water for Elephants. It is the exciting tale of a young, veterinary student who ends up working for a third-rate, somewhat corrupt, traveling circus. He cares for the circus animals, while encountering danger, episodes of animal cruelty, violence and romance. It is a heart-pounding and endearing tale, told mostly in flashback.  The characters are larger-than-life, from the cruel circus owner, to the sideshow freaks, to the bawdy young ladies who perform for the grinning men - both onstage ... and off. I just loved this book from start to finish. And for those of you who have seen the film, the book has much more action, and less focus on the romantic angle. An action-packed, colorful story. I could not put it down.

I'm trying to hold back and be nice, remembering I just finished rereading The Great Gatsby (and there's not much that can compare to that)!  Overall, I liked the book.  I found the depiction of circus and railroad life during the depression very interesting.  It appeared that the author did some in depth research.  The flashback technique between the circus and the nursing home, however, left me flat.  I did not feel that the nursing home chapters were of the same quality as the circus chapters and frankly rushed through them to get back to the "real" story.  If anyone starts the book, however, keep going as the ending is well done.My disappointment in this book came from the author's handling of important thematic materials.  The scene was set for so many important (and universal) statements and the author simply threw them away.  So much could have been written about class structure, disability awareness, capitalism, fairness in advertising, care of the elderly, animal rights, etc. and nothing came forth.  There was no symbolism or connections to classic themes, and I sure missed the place where the main character was equated with the biblical Jacob.  Those efforts would have made the difference between a book that will last and one that won't be remembered in ten years.

OK - I admit it.  I really liked this book.  My wife was shocked that I wanted to read it, but she had loved it so much I thought I would give it a try.  It is such an interesting story.  You can tell it was well researched as it truly brings to life the way circus people lived nearly 100 years ago.The characters are memorable.  You really feel that you know Jacob and all the performers in the Benzini Brothers Circus.  The story revolves around a love triangle all set within the context of the depression and circus life.  This does not come across at all like a romance novel.  The story is well-crafted and keeps the reader's interest.  All key items I look for in a book.  There were a few fights intermingled to keep my sense of action / adventure happy too.Pros:o well researched depression era circus lifeo wonderful characters who you grow to know and loveo full telling of story - you don't feel like anything was left outCons:o none big enough to comment onOverall - I highly recommend this book.  A great American novel.

This novel is a beautiful love story surrounded by a fascinating spectacle. It goes without saying that if you are a circus lover you will really enjoy reading this book. Sara Gruen provokes tears, smiles, and sighs along with other emotional reactions from the reader by encompassing circus life without failing to include any heart wrenching details. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to go on a circus adventure and test the resilience of love.

Wow, 1696 reviews to date!  Oprah's recommendation really can motivate a lot of women with time on their hands LOL!  I won't even bother to read the 5-star reviews because I'll probably agree with all the specifics about what a good book this is.  It has colorful, well-fleshed out characters with only a few cardboard stereotypes, great sense of historical and circus detail, and a neat surprise ending.The trouble is, this does not belong up there with some great recent, innovative works, the true 5-stars, like Memoirs of a Geisha or The Kite Runner.  One thing they all have in common is introducing us to a foreign or unfamiliar world, in this case the depression-era circus.  But those other two books have a depth of soul, and a more comprehensive world-view, than Water for Elephants.I was also disappointed with a big, loose thread in the plot, where Camel was to be reunited with his son and the reader was set for that pivotal event, only to be let down and short-circuited by the surprise ending.You will definitely enjoy this book, and be enlightened to learn more about life during the Depression, but keep it in perspective, let's not give standing ovations for every good show.

One of the Stern Librarian's great challenges is to get patrons who say they don't like novels to read them.  Water for Elephants is the novel I will now be pressing on those people who say they only like reading history or biography rather than fiction.  Although readers will get lost in the invented world in this book, they will also learn a great deal of real facts about the Depression, train circuses and animal behavior along the way.  And they will feel the plight of Americans in the grip of economic panic in ways that most history books cannot convey.  Photographs at the beginning of most chapters both illustrate the plot and confirm that most of this unbelievable story really did happen.  I particularly loved learning about the mechanics of circuses, how they were set up, taken down, how the crowd was shaken for every last nickel, how they performers and animals were fed and housed.  The paperback edition contains an interview with the author and other notes that describe the research that went into the book and reveal that a few of the more amazing events in the novel actually occurred.  As if the glamour of old circuses weren't enough, this book also contains a second story set in present day about an elderly man in a nursing home.  Many readers have told me that they take to this old man's voice like elephants to lemonade.  The Stern Librarian (I work for peanuts too).

I was born in 1920.  I grew up during the Great Depression and the Prohibition eras.In 1965 we owned a bait and tackle shop in Venice, Florida.  At that time the Ringling Bros. Circus wintered there and we became acquainted with many circus people.  Our shop was a hangout for them and every evening after rehearsals they would stop by for a beer.The book: "Water for Elephants" is extremely well written and I am planning to read more of Sara Gruen's work.I have ordered two more copies and given them to friends.  They have given me very good reports.

I have strongly mixed feelings about _Water for Elephants_.  The alternating story between the daily life of a 90-ish year old man and his cantankerous behaviour with his youth as a circus vet kept my attention; the details about the social heirarchy between members of the circus was (on the authority of a former circus roustabout friend of mine) accurate; and I have to admit, I am a sucker for a love story.  However, as previous reviewers have noted, the 1930's vernacular, and the mannerisms of men of that era were abhorrent - but then I am a stickler for these kinds of detail.The story - of a Cornell vet student who quits his final exams before graduation to join the circus and his subsequent adventures (and love story) has undoubtedly caught the imagination of the vast majority of Amazon reviewers - including myself.  Yet I deduct a star because of the lack of attention to detail regarding the male protagonists and the verbage of the time.  For most readers, this apparently isn't an issue, in which case I would stronlgy recommend it.As far as breezy summer reads go, this certainly fits the bill - who *hasn't* fantasized about running off with the circus?  (Happily oblivious to the hard work, long hours and mediocre pay ...)  Which among us doesn't dream (or hasn't dreamed) of finding  your soul-mate on such an adventure?  Recommended, particularly for the romantics among us.

Almost every child has dreamed about running away to join the circus.  In the days of the big top, there were lots of menial jobs that kept those who wanted to be part of the circus busy from before dawn into late into the night, even if those jobs often involved nothing more glamorous than shoveling up the remains of an elephant's snack.Water for Elephants starts with an elderly (at least 90 years old) Jacob Jankowski remembering snatches of his past as he frets over the indignities of living in a nursing home while his children ignore him except for token rotating visits on Sundays.  One memory in particular stands out, a violent memory that he didn't share with anyone for over 70 years.Most of the book moves through flashback into the 1930s when America was broke and people were starving.  Into this challenging world, Jacob has high expectations as he finishes up his veterinary training at Cornell.  But the hand of God intervenes, and his life will never be the same.He soon finds himself serving in any role that he can get at BENZINI BROS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH (as the rail cars read).  This isn't the big time.  It's just surviving by staying one step ahead of the local sheriffs while not delivering on promised acts and providing entertainment for men that has nothing to do with being a circus.  This circus doesn't even have an elephant.Much of the story involves the nitty gritty of how circuses operated in those perilous times.  It's a story that encompasses lots of cruelty, deceit, and harshness.  In fact, it's enough to make you wonder why you ever dreamed about running away to join the circus.  So if you would like to keep that dream shiny, perhaps this wouldn't be the best book for you to read.At the center of the story are three people and one elephant.  Marlena is the queen of the circus, the star of the equestrian act that involves first 12 and later 10 horses.  She's married to the volatile August who runs the animal acts.  When Jacob becomes involved in caring for the animals, Jacob is invited to dine and party with the couple.  The relationship becomes more complicated when Jacob finds himself drawn to Marlena and repelled by August.  When the circus buys an abandoned elephant that seems unusually stupid, the equilibrium is destroyed.Ultimately, the book is about responsibility and loyalty . . . qualities that are more important in and taken more seriously by the circus world than by the "rubes" who attend the circus.  The message will serve as yet another indictment of our modern world which favors efficiency over doing the right thing.The book is beautifully illustrated with vintage photographs of early circuses that nicely match the story line of Water for Elephants.Unlike many authors of such historical fiction, Sara Gruen does a good job of keeping a few surprises up her sleeve.  So don't quit mid-book thinking you know how the story will turn out.Grab a shovel . . . and dig in!

I've had this book on my shelf for a while...the circus has never really interested me--but it's been on the bestsellers list for so long...it just must be great, right? Well it's okay--but I'm convinced it's the ending that's leaves readers recommending it to friends. It has a typical Hollywood happy ending.The story prior to the ending is nice enough. It's pretty short and has a few interesting photos taken from the Ringling archives. I thought the details of the Great Depression were woven niceley into the story and it seemed well researched.That being said I don't think the story was as deep or detailed as it could have been. Gruen obviously had some rich material at her fingertips. I can't help but think she could have done more with it.I also found the constant interjection of Old Man Jacob Jankoski distracting and annoying. Although, the parts are well-written and moving--definitely makes me twice about the elderly--He seems completely unnecesarry to the plot of the novel and I thought his space in the book should have been filled with something else-preferably, the developing romance between Marlena and Jacob.Pluses: Cover, Research, subject manner, Walter "Kinko", The ending. Photos.Cons: Characters are dull or overwrought, story is eh, Old Man Jankowski distracts from circus plot.

As a prize-winning author myself, and a Pulitzer nominee, I know good writing.  This book was so riveting and fascinating I couldn't put it down.In fact, it became so real to me that I began to think of it as non-fiction some time after I'd finished.  I had to read these reviews to recollect it is fiction.  Having read a great many of the posted reviews, I can't help noticing the negative or low rated reviews are sneering and superior, and critical in the extreme.  This is, in my experience, typical of poor writers who feel compelled to comment scathingly on others' skills, but who are incapable of writing compelling literature themselves.  As a professional academic reviewer, I strongly disagree with the snide commentary.  It is a rare gem.

I was hesitant to read this book at first because I was concerned about the animal abuse. However, Sara Gruen did a wonderful job with keeping it at a minimum. I quickly scanned over one or two of the scenes and then realized when I was done reading the story, how the little bit of it added to the story.Well researched and well defined, Gruen takes you by the hand and leads you into the life of an elderly man who, from a nursing home, reflects back on his life in his younger years while he was a part of the circus life. Vivid and captivating, I felt as though I was a part of this exciting journey.There are thousands of reviews on this book, so I'll keep mine brief. Clearly stated, this is one work that will remain in my memory all the days of my life. Fascinating!!

This review originally appeared on my blog.If you are considering trying audio books, I think this would be an excellent one to start with. I loved the narrators, they really added something extra to the story. Also this story is meant to be told orally and listening to it really makes it all come to life.I was a bit worried when I decided to listen to this book. I don't usually like books that involve animals, mostly because of the guaranteed heart fail. Not only does this book have animals, it is set in a circus. Having worked as a zookeeper, I learned some of the not so nice things that happen to circus animals. Then add to it, the story is set during the Depression. All of these had me cringing a bit. But who hasn't dreamed of running off to the circus?I was hooked in the first few minutes of the reading. I could tell that it would be a story I would lose myself in. I have to say though I was a little annoyed with the music playing in the background. Particularly with the older narrator as it made it difficult for me to hear him clearly.Oddly enough, it was the scenes of the older Jacob that had tears coming to my eyes, rather than the animals. It sucks to be old and his story is probably far more common than not. Though I did cringe every time August had a scene with Rosie. I was also a little shocked at the debauchery that took place at a circus (today it is such a family event).The descriptive nature of the story had me feeling like I was there at the circus. I could smell the popcorn. hear the cheer of the crowd, and when I closed my eyes I was in the menagerie with all the sights and sounds that come with a tent full of animals. More so than any other audio book I've listened to, there was a mini movies running through my mind.I went to see the movie a couple of days after finishing the book. I don't usually like to see the movie version so soon after finishing a book because the details of the book are so fresh in my mind. But I have to say, the movie was so well done that I fell even more in love with the story. The movie left out the parts that I found annoying in the book (in particular the back and forth between the old Jacob and young Jacob). I do have to say that I was a tiny bit upset that BoBo was cut from the film. I think he might have been my favorite animal.

This book begins and ends with the main character, Jacob Jankowski, in his 90's and residing in a nursing home.  He doesn't remember how old he is or even the people that take turns coming to visit him.  But what he does remember more than makes up for his current state of boredom.  The beginning reminded me of Stephen King's "The Green Mile".  The author obviously had to do a great deal of research into circus life during the depression in order to write this book.  What she found does not make a pleasant story.  Being an animal lover, the cruelty displayed toward the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, really disturbed me.  I still have a hard time believing that Jacob, who had nearly received his degree as a veterinarian and loved Rosie, would not have done more to prevent it. The cruelty displayed towards the employees was just as bad.  Railroad goons would actually push workers off moving trains in the middle of the night rather than pay them.  I thought the affair between Jacob and Marlena was not as torrid as it should have been.  Rosie was my favorite character - she was described in human terms which made the cruelty more difficult to endure.  In the end, both the peon workers and Rosie got even.  But that was not even the ending that made this book such a great read.  I was so excited when I read the ending, I had to tell someone about it!  It was the best ending ever!!

This book was highly recommended to me by women in an assisted living facility where I teach, for whom one of the book themes--aging and loss of autonomy--resonated deeply. I found it an engaging read, though the story almost caves in under the weight of the author's research. The characters are archetypes I had the feeling I'd seen somewhere before, lacking complexity, and it was ultimately difficult to care about any of them. The shifts back and forth in time were distracting and superfluous. I felt manipulated by the fantastically sentimental ending, but still, it made me smile.

When my two sons were perhaps 6 and 10, I took them to the circus here in Salt Lake City, Utah.  They were remarkably nonplussed:  "Duh Dad, a bear riding a bicycle?"  And so, going back in time 75 years to get the look and feel of circuses was a lot of fun.  Dusty, stinky, hard work, low pay, railroads, animals escaping, fat ladies, dwarves, clowns, all of it.  But the heart of the book is the story of Jacob, a young veterinarian (who hasn't yet passed the exam), who is pulled out of his orderly life and into the circus world virtually overnight.  And suddenly, here he is, in a different world, a young and handsome 23 year old being used and abused by the men and women in this crazy circus sub-world.The story is told by Jacob at age 93 and now living in a rest-home.  Going between old Jacob with nurses clucking about trying to get him to behave, and then going back in time telling the circus story, reminds me of the old lady's perspective in the movie, "The Titanic,"  who is telling the story of young Jack and her life altering romance with him.  There's something about the technique that makes it all seem very real, like it's all in the present.Jacob's romance with one of the young, beautiful circus performers is a touching and believable tale.  The hucksterisms of his two bosses who run the circus, are also very realistic and an important part of the story.  I won't give too much away here, in case you haven't yet read the book, but an elephant named Rosie is also one of the main characters of the book who makes sure things turn out as they're supposed to.A very fun, touching and unique piece of american historical fiction.

This book does provide a fairly riveting story set within post depression America and also provides good insights into the circus business during this era. The book balances the dynamics of maintaining a circus in tough economic times against a host of vivid and disparate personalities that can both support and challenge the stability of the circus. For example there is Big Al who runs the circus with a nearly ruthless practicality, "redlighting" individuals who violate his rules. There is August, second in command, alternately tough and gracious, supportive and cruel. There is Jacob, the hero, who stumbles into the world after fleeing Cornell Vet School and who subsequently falls in love with August's wife. The book alternates between the young Jacob in the circus and the elderly Jacob in a nursing home. Some of the dialogue the characters use during the depression era sounds like it came from the 21st century but other than that there is a gritty, often grotesque and unblinking realism in everything from death to romance.

Note on Kindle version: A number of minor glitches: Typos in some of the latter chapters and the author's note appeared twice; The first was joined to the last sentence, unseparated by any spacing (this one's pretty annoying, in fact). Other than that, reads beautifully, the images in between chapters appeared fine and crisp, dictionary functions well.Water for Elephants is one of those big, entertaining read that is packed with action and wonderful details, and, of course, a love story. From the first few pages there you get a clear sense that the story is just tailor made for the movies. The structure of the narration, the intricate period details as well as the classic twists and turn of the plot makes you feel like you are, quite literally, reading a movie. I could even hear faint soundtrack music in the background as I flipped through the pages!Jacob Jankowski, Ivy League vet science student, found himself on the road after his life is turned upside down by a freak accident. He made a fateful jump on a passing train, which turned out to a travelling circus. Soon after, he finds himself employed as the circus vet and falls head over heels for the star of the troupe, Marlena, who just happened to be the wife of the schizophrenic head of the menagerie. Then one day, an elephant joins the troupe and everything started to unravel.The love story itself is filled with cliches. Young man falls in love with a woman out of his reach, thinks his love in unrequited but can't help to yearn for her and therefore continues to woe her. And just when he thought his chances are gone, she confesses that the feeling's mutual. Aha, what about the evil, schizo husband? Well, they go through heaven and hell to escape him and that's basically it. The love story.And so it's not a surprise that the characters are not of great depth. Jacob is the naive, testosterone-bursting young fella who knows what or who he wants but doesn't have a clue how to get it. And is showered with luck and good friends to support him. Marlena, is the charming damsel in distress and her husband the wicked yet brilliant villain.But all those flaws, as great as they seem, are overridden by Gruen's superbly paced and gripping storytelling of a magical world of a bygone era. The world of the travelling circus in the 1930s she described just sucks you in. The lack of depth of the human character is replaced by the depth of character of their animal counterparts. Rex and Leo, the lions, Bobo the chimp and Rosie the Elephant. The story just came alive with all those great period details.Also, despite of the predictable outcome of the love story, it is the structure of the narration that keeps you glued until the last page. Gruen zooms back and forth between Jacob's old self, a miserable 93 yo in a nursing home, wifeless and seen as a mere duty to his family and his young self. The way old Jacob yearns for life is all too familiar and is echoed in the young Jacob's lust for life. Ultimately, you want to know what happens to both Jacobs: Will the young Jacob win his love, and will the old Jacob regains his peace of mind?Finally, this is not high literature. Like a circus show, Water for Elephants is entertaining, exhillirating, memorable, beautiful and therefore makes a great holiday read. Recommended.

Calling it a love story doesn't do it justice as it is so much more. Really liked the meticulously researched historical aspects of the story both from the point of view of America in depression and also a backstage pass into traveling circuses of that time, which alone was worth the price of admission.

Water for Elephants is highly fascinating, both in plot develoment as well as historical presentation. Gruen obviously invested an abundance of time researching the subject because the novel is rich with sensory imagery. Some folks may be bothered by the seedy side of the circus, but I don't think Gruen's goal was to paint a manufactured tale of such transitory, poor misfits.

I spent most of this book disliking it. I hated the constant depiction of cruelty to animals and people; I hated the griminess inherent in the depiction of circus life; and I hated the naivete of main character Jacob Jankowski, the poor veterinary student forced by a cruel twist of fate to seek shelter and employment with the Benzini Brothers traveling circus.It took me forever to make it through the first 100 pages, and the only reason I stuck with it was because I was just too lazy to go pick out another book to read. This is the one that was on my bed so this is the one I picked up to read every night before going to sleep.Finally I reached the 100th page and was ready to turn to something else, but to my surprise, I realized that I wanted to know what was going to happen. I had become interested in the character of Rosie the elephant, who was rescued from another show, and I wanted to make sure things came out all right for her in the end. I actually read the entire last third of the book in one setting. I still wasn't enjoying it, mind you, but I was really worried about Rosie!I am not going to relate the plot because I don't want to give any spoilers, but let me just say that the ending of the book was one of the sweetest, most satisfying book endings I have ever read in my life. I still don't like the book, but I love the ending!

I really enjoyed this book as I found it a very quick read with characters I was interested in.Water for elephants is told by an ornery man (Jacob Jankowki, about 90 years old), whose life now consists of residing in an assisted living center, where his children visit when they can.The story goes back and forth from his life in the present, to his life in the past, when by a turn of fate, he found himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Circus, as their Vet.  The time is the 1920-1930's  and we get to see life during The Great Depression.Their are many eccentric characters, and if you love the circus and animals, there is plenty of that for you.  I found the story of the circus performers lives fascinating.  It really is a great read.

Hard to stop reading, Gruen spins a wonderful tale with vivid characters.  Even the pitiful elephants have a role, as all sentient being should. But Gruen is never preachy.  She lays out the story for the enjoyment of the reader.  Good juicy book.

After seeing this book on the top of the lists with so many stars I figured this would be a great book.Honestly, I don't get any of the 5 star ratings claiming it's the greatest book, couldn't put it down etc.The story is decent, and I found myself wanting to read it, but all the time I felt like the story was going to be pick up at any moment and get REALLY exciting. I mean cmon!  It's a nearly 5 star book! Except that it never did.  Not even when it go the "exciting" part.One reviewer mentioned that it seemed as if the author realized they need to "wrap it up" and hustled the story along.  Where a day in the beginning took several pages, when it finally got to the "good stuff"...it was all done in a few paragraphs or very few pages.  It was an ok read at best, but it's not a 5 star book.  A 5 star book should be a book that consumes you and stays with you when it's over.  This book simply didn't do that.  It told a story, wrapped up and ended.It almost seemed like the author didn't really connect or have real grasp on the characters when writing the "past" parts.  When she wrote about elderly Jacob, it was spot on and you really felt what Jacob was feeling and got immersed into his world.  While when reading about young Jacob, you feel more like you are just reading a story about someone.  For me the best books are those that put you in the world of the character, and for whatever reason, Sara could only do this in the present storyline.Also, the ending of the present day Jacob was a little lackluster I thought, and completely unrealistic.  It kind of took away from what good the book had.Bottom line:  it's an ok read, but I can't say that I'll be going around recommending it to my friends or anyone who asks about it.COMPLAINT:  Before I reviewed this Kindle Book...it was $5.00.  When I bought it, the price had gone up to $6.39.  I noticed that the cover changed to the "movie one".  This seems RIDICULOUS since Kindle readers don't really have a use for covers.  Also, the original book has old time pictures of circus people.  The Kindle version does NOT have this, because the movie book doesn't have them either (I checked in a local store). Which makes sense in that you can't have a movie cover with pictures that don't relate to the movie so they were evidently removed.  But I was not happy that I paid more for a book with less just because two actors now grace it's cover on an ebook.  And if I had any cover, I'd prefer the original anyway.

isn't pretty - neglect of the elderly, abuse of animals, abuse of humans, slavery, penury, starvation, mental illness, and murder. Authoress Gruen plunks you right down amidst it all. You are really there. And the epilogue is a real shocker (pun intended). Let's just say, Thomas Edison wasn't exactly Saint Thomas.

I was skeptical of a book detailing life in a traveling circus.  But overall this was an entertaining and well written book.  There were a few things that didn't flow well or weren't really explained (or at least I didn't understand them) like why Jacob was so outraged at the gentleman who said he had worked at the circus or for what reason Marlena was throwing a suprise for her husband (that ended up going poorly).  But these uncertainties didn't stop me from enjoying the story.  Surprising twist.  Sweet ending.

When Jacob Jankoswki learns of the death of both of his parents in an automobile accident, his grief renders him unable to sit for his final exams at Cornell Vet school and he hops the first train he sees out of town. Fate has intervened, however, and it turns out that the train belongs to a traveling circus, which ends up hiring him on as the show's animal doctor. The year is 1931, jobs are scarce, and, as Jacob quickly discovers, Uncle Al, the show's unforgiving ring master, and August rule the circus with an iron hand. Performers are treated well, but working men often go unpaid or worse, are "red lighted," or thrown off the moving train in the dead of night. It is a brutal world, and Jacob walks its fine line between working men and performers. One day Jacob falls in love with Marlena, the show's star attraction and the wife of homicidally paranoid schizophrenic August, and their worlds at the circus will never be the same.This is an excellent and engrossing novel, told from the point of view of Jacob both in 1931 and today, with him at age 93 and in a nursing home, reflecting on past memories. Pull back the tent flap and step right in to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. You will yearn to be sitting in the circus train's boxcar, curled up with a book by the light of a flickering kerosene lantern amidst the folds of big top canvas as you roll on through the night to the next town and the next big show.

As I have stated before, one of my MANY quirks is that I must read a book before I watch the movie. When I read in Entertainment Weekly the Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison would be starring in the film adaptation of Water for Elephants, I knew that I had to pick it up. I rarely pay full price for a book. However, this one had such rave reviews that I couldn't help myself. Still, it sat on my bookcase until this week when I promised to read it before the opening of the movie. Honestly, I was greatly disappointed.Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski who is so distraught after his parents' deaths that he runs away with the circus. He leaves between his education at Cornell University and his future as a veterinarian. Fortunately, his study of veterinary medicine helps him land a job as the circus' vet. While touring with the circus he meets a number of characters from a red haired midget clown, to an old circus worker who is struck with "jake walk" (a condition brought on by drinking tainted whiskey). Jacob soon discovers that life on the road is beyond trying. When an elephant is brought on as part of the show, Jacob finds himself torn between his job as a compassionate vet and the rules of the circus. This causes Jacob to bump heads with his boss, August, who is beyond temperamental and at times masochistic. To complicate matters, Jacob is in love with the lead actress of the show, Malena, who just happens to be August's wife.While the subject matter of the circus would seem to be incredibly interesting, this novel was boring from start to finish. The entire plot was cliched, the relationships were shallow, and the characters were without depth. From the first chapter, I knew the exact path that the novel was going to take. Every time I thought to put the book down, I convinced myself to give it one more chance. It was after all a bestseller, therefore, I thought it would get better. It never did. If anything, it got worse as every cliche was reinforced. The only twist came at the very end and was so absurd I had to re-read the last few pages three times over to make sure that I read it correctly. A book is only as good as its character development but in this novel there is no development. Though Jacob attempts to mature, he can't seem to figure out what his priorities are. Incidentally, neither can Gruen for she has Jacob bemoan his conflicting emotions between his love for Marlena and his feelings towards animal abuse. Fortunately for Jacob, the animals take their fate into their own hands which relieves Jacob of having to develop. I hope, for the box office's sake, that the movie fails to resemble the book. Either way, I will not be the first in line at the theater.

This book is a page turner, but it certainly did not live up to the hype. It is reminiscent of older works like The Great Gatsby and Fifth Business, but doesn't try to be deep. Yes, the point of view of the old man was done well, but frankly quite boring. The love story felt flat (what exactly did they see in each other? neither had any personality)

90-ish Jacob Jankowski narrates his story in flashbacks from a nursing home. His days with the circus feel more real and alive to him than his current reality.After his parents are killed in a car accident, Jacob runs out on his vet school exams and joins the circus. Circus life is not always easy, but Jacob has experiences with humans and animals that change his life forever.Gruen brings the Depression-era circus vividly to life, along with its many colorful characters. If Rosie the elephant and Bobo the orangutan don't touch your heart, it's made of stone!Highly recommended!

I had hesitated purchasing this book as I had read mediocre reviews of the movie when it came out.  I was hooked from the first chapter!  The chapters set in the nursing home had me laughing out loud!  Some of the animal cruelty segments were very difficult to read but the book is very well written and almost makes you feel as if you are right there with the circus family!  I have already highly recommended it to friends.

This book was easy reading, but was also kind of facile and read like a treatment for a movie script (and I am sure there will be a movie).  I think we were supposed to find crotchety old Jacob lovably cantankerous, but I just thought he was annoying.  The circus story (featuring young Jacob) was much better, but all it has is plot--characters don't really develop, writing is passable but not skilled.

Water for Elephants took a little while to fully grab my attention, with the flash backs between the circus and Jacob's time in the nursing home.  Once it got my attention it held it right through to the very end.There were a few relationships that stood out in my mind.  The first was between Rosemary and Jacob.  Their relationship exemplified the relationship I would hope all nursing home staff had with the residents.  Her understanding and patience as Jacob flashes back and forth between the present day and his youth is remarkable, and her connection seems to surpass the bond he shares with his children.I never would have thought I would enjoy a book that centered around the cicus, but this novel was about so much more than just the shows under the big top.  It focused on love, friendship, aging and compassion.

I read this book because my sister-in-law (who never reads) could not put it down until she finished. So I gave it a go and, after a slow start, was interested enough to finish. The author does everything she can to exploit the reader's concern for cats, dogs, monkeys and, of course, the titular elephant. The narrator  is a vet who sticks with the circus, at first, in order to protect the animals, but he does little to interfere with their mistreatment... or the mistreatment of his fellow humans. In that sense, the book rings false. The book exploits the reader's feeling for animals and animal-human relationships for some cheap emotional effect. And it worked on me to some extent because I  cared about (and shed shed tears for) the animals much more than the humans. But I fail to see larger point.

I agree with several other people who found it amazing that this is a bestseller. As an author whose books sell poorly right here on Amazon, I wish I knew her secret. I found it disgusting on so many levels, hard to follow, and in the end, just not worth reading. Perhaps something in the last third of the book would have changed my mind, but I couldn't finish it. I can't remember the last time I threw a book into the garbage can, but I looked it over carefully, thought about the very act of throwing out a book, and then dropped it into the trash. I don't regret it.

A sad story, beautifully told. Gruen cuts effortlessly between a faultless evocation of a seedy circus during the Depression - a grotesquerie if ever there was one -  and the modern-day life of an nonagenarian trapped in a failing body and a souless nursing home. Gruen's vivid prose and dead-on dialog transport the reader to a place and time, both physical and emotional, that does not fail to fascinate.  What in less talented hands might easily be a depressing tale of old age is animated by the spunk and wit of her main character.  My only complaint about the story is its ending, which I frankly found implausible.  But that's a minor complaint about an otherwise absorbing book.

Creating a story where your main character is alternately 93 and 23 (or so) is a daunting task for any author, but Sara Gruen yanks us around with grace. "Jacob Joins the Circus" is not in the thoughts of either Jacob but life is funny for a vet student who suffers a personal crisis, hits the rails and jumps onto the only train filled with patients for whom he's trained to assist and human subjects of a certain period.It's 1931 and the Great Depression is in full stench. With creatures of every variety in need of his services, Jacob becomes part of the Benzini Brothers, a circus dying to be Ringling Brothers and as we learn, their management, headed up by Uncle Al, a brute in anyone's managerie is ready to literally dump dead weight and steal what he needs to drive that train where he wants it to go. Jacob endears himself as a necessary component and survives the late night "redlighting" that makes roadkill of certain colleagues.Love springs eternal as both young and old Jacob encounter women who make the journey worth hanging for. When the elephant comes to town, the men of both eras are drawn closer still and we can feel their joy, their pain, their passion writ in every color of the literary rainbow. Ms. Gruen clearly has a passion for the subject and has researched every nuance and trick of the period(s) and the ride is a rollick. Certain characters pop in without much preamble and we feel genuine pain for little Walter and his doggie, and for Casey, the victim of "the Jake," an ailment wished on no person. The deepest sympathy is felt for the largest of creatures, Rosie, and we wince at every poke of the trainer's prod, every command misunderstood and yet she's not why we bought a ticket to the show.Water for Elephants avoids the traps of a parable, or a fairy tale, or a moralistic thriller, and we're left with what we came for: a well paced story filled with great characters who remain there after the day ends and by the end of the ride, it's a Book for Everyone.

His frustration with the tricks his body and mind had played on him were real and understandable.  His joy at the end of the book put a grin on my face. I know there have been quite a few of you who found the profanity excessive and gratuitous, but I think it fit the station of life and the time period and would not let it stop me from a book this enjoyable.

"Water for Elephants" was the last Book Club selection I read, and It was not my choice. Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.  This is one book that I feel I wasted far too much time on.  I didn't even really finish it as I was still several chapters away from the end the night before our meeting.Take a look at my reviews to see some really wonderful books and see if you agree with me.Eileen F.

Books are entertainment.  There are some that get taught flying lessons, but overall, most manage to accomplish that goal.  Some you enjoy while the book is open and then forget as you close the cover on the last page.  Some may stay with you a day, a week, a month.  These you probably tell your friends about.  Most are interruptible if something else comes along.  The phone rings, your neighbor comes knocking, cat fight in the yard, world peace is declared; you dog-ear the corner, set it aside and get back to it later.And then there is that rare book you open to the first page and several hours later, your butt numb, your joints stiff from inactivity, your eyes misting, your vision blurred, you close the cover on the last page.  That rare book that sucks you in so completely you lose track of time and place.  You look up from the page at your surroundings and feel a momentary confusion.  The morning light that was streaming through your window when you started reading is now afternoon light coming through the door.  That rare book that, as you race mid-way through, you wish with all your heart it would never end.  That rare book you long to jump into, become a part of, live forever in.Water For Elephants by Sara Gruen is such a book.

I thought this topic would be very interesting, as you get to see the inner workings of a Circus. That's something I'd never read about and DID find interesting, and it's probably what kept me reading all the way to the end.The characters however were not that well developed, especially Marlena. Most of the time she comes off as an airheaded child, a woman easily fooled and manipulated. It's also sort of difficult to really imagine Jacob and Marlena being so completely in love, as they don't really have anything in common other than their love of animals. Also not a big fan of the book flashing back and forth between 22 year old Jacob and 91 year old Jacob. Most of the "old Jacob" chapters are tedious to read and the payoff at the end with him is pretty small--especially as you aren't really sure how he got to be so grumpy and bitter.The main thing I disliked about this book is that it gives away the ending in the first chapter. You know the bad guy is going to die from page 1. So the rest of the book has you feeling pretty indifferent because you already know what the outcome will be. You already know the hero prevails and the tension or the thrill of finding out what will happen is gone.

When a friend recommended this book I was hesitant because I normally do not like novels that revolve around history or romance. I honestly read the book to appease my friend, and was blown away by the characters and the storyline. The book was definitely not the boring and corny romance story I expected it to be. I found Water for Elephants to be captivating, humorous, and heartbreaking.The book begins with a young veterinary student who discovers that his parents have been killed in a car accident. He returns home to find that he has been left with nothing and that his parents had put everything at stake for his ivy league education. When they died their home, veterinary practice, and savings were all lost to the bank. Overcome by grief, he is unable to complete his finals and runs away from everything and everyone he knows. At a loss for direction and purpose, he jumps a train in the dead of night hoping to find himself in a strange town where he can start to live again. Instead, he finds himself on a circus train, where he becomes engrossed in a community unlike anything that he has ever experienced. The weeks and months that follow are both his saving grace and his living hell.

What an intriguing story!  From the first gripping lines of the prologue, I was pulled into the world of the traveling circus, a world I had purposefully avoided until now.  Told through the perspective of an elderly man's recollections, this book is full of grit, empathy, and adventure, and is a sharp portrayal of the seedier side of the depression era sideshow life.  The author juxtaposed greed, sloth, abuse, mental illness, and the fascinating circus world of cheap glamour and talented charlatans against the bittersweet remembrances of an old man and his present day frustration with trying to live life more fully at an advanced age.  There is a little surprise at the end that I had not foreseen.  The back of the book describes this work with words like vivid, rich, and riveting.  It is all of those things and more - a great story well told.  Water for elephants is highly recommended.

I think I liked every single page of this book. It was a well-written semi-historical account of circus life and human interaction, but it wasn't over written. Definitely one of the better books I've read. It did move a bit slowly, but it's difficult to notice how slowly a book moves when you read it quickly. I imagine if I had read this book over the stretch of a week or two, it would have been a little less interesting. However, it did motivate me to keep reading, so I doubt I would have wanted to stretch it out that long.

Fascinating and riveting novel, chockerblock full of vivid historical detail about life in a second rate traveling circus during the depression in the United States. It was a real glimpse of Americana because of the author's meticulous research. All the elements of a great read: love, desire, action, humor, murder, and a totally surprising and superb ending. The true heroine is a wonderful elephant named Rosie.

One of my biggest indicators of a well-written book is if I am transported to that world in such a way that I can see, hear, and even smell it. Sara Gruen sweeps a 93 year old Jacob Jankowski quickly into your heart before tossing you into the world of his 23 year old self. We are there to witness the moment in this man's life when the smooth path he is on is up-heaved with the death of his parents and the loss of his future veterinary practice. His new course turns out to be on the tracks and with the belly of the circus.With the help of an old roustabout, Jacob learns the language and hierarchy of the circus, and eventually lands a job as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth's vet. We learn with our protagonist the dirty reality of day to day life of a traveling circus in 1931. A colorful host of secondary characters help Jacob on his journey, with the most important being Marlena, the show's star equestrian, and her husband, the cruel animal master, August.Jacob and Marlena's paths soon become twisted and intertwined as the fall in love, and try to find their escape from her insane, brutal husband and the circus that they are trapped in serving. Their answer comes in the form of an elephant named Rosie, and a fateful disaster that destroys those holding them back, while free the lovers to their happily ever after.This story comes full circle in the end as 93 year old Jacob finds himself once again at the gates of the big top, and is given a chance to go home once again.

I decided to read Water for Elephants because I discovered that Robert Pattinson is going to star in the movie version of it. As you may or may not know, I am a HUGE fan of Robert Pattinson. I definitely like him more than I should. Robert Pattinson aside, I am so glad I read this book. I did not know what to expect, but it was absolutely amazing!The main character, Jacob, is so easy to like. He has lived an extremely interesting life. In the beginning, he is a veterinarian student who is about to take his final test to become a full-fledged vet. Unfortunately for him, a tragedy claims his parents' lives, and he becomes too emotionally broken to even start the test. He ends up jumping on a train that happens to be a circus train, so he is practically thrown into this world as the circus vet.I really loved this book for so many reasons. One, Jacob is a vet (sort of), which I love because that is what I want to do. You can obviously tell he loves animals. The characters were complex and intriguing. The bad guys like August and Uncle Al had so many levels to them that they were often hard to read. Rosie, the elephant, was probably one of my favorite characters. Even if she is an elephant, she was so funny and smart! She definitely made the story so much better because I could not help but love her.Water for Elephants is an amazing book. Sara Gruen is such a talented writer that it is no wonder I love this book so much. With the action, forbidden love, hard choices, loss, and so much more, Water for Elephants is one of the best books I have ever read. It captivated me from page 1. I absolutely love this book, and it is now one of my favorites.

This beautifully written novel opens with Jacob, age 93 or 90 - he doesn't remember which.  The book flashes back and forth from Jacob's present life in an old-age home to his young adult life caring for animals in a traveling circus.  Though a bit over the top, this story is so marvelously told that I found myself turning page after page savoring the prose.

Jacob Jankowski is ninety-three or ninety and resides in a nursing home, visited once a week by family members.  When a circus comes to town and sets up camp nearby, Jacob remembers his stint on a traveling circus during the Depression.  As a young man, he studied veterinary science at Cornell, but a family tragedy caused him to change his course.  Once enlisted as the circus vet, Jacob meets an array of colorful people and animals, who are by turns, violent, gentle, mercurial and loyal. When he falls in love with the wife of one of his colleagues, trouble arises. resulting in tragedy. However, there is a second act in the senior Jacob's life, as it turns out he is not yet through being part of a circus.This is an unforgettable book that depicts a world that will be unfamiliar to many readers. Those who have enjoyed Ms. Gruen's earlier horse novels will likely enjoy this as well, although it is written ina different style.  A deserved bestseller, "Water For Elephants" is a heartwarming story and a ripping yarn, as the Brtish might say.

On my list of "Books to Read," I finally got around to reading Sarah Gruen's "Water for Elephants" and found myself up until the wee hours of the morning finishing the last breathtaking page.This is the kind of book that is so well researched and told that it captivates you - much like the circus it portrays - with feats of beauty and astonishment.I really loved this book, and was somewhat disappointed by the movie - which, as always, changes certain aspects of the book and allows for director/artistic interpretation of scenes contrary to my original interpretation. But that's the beauty of books and individual interpretation - they are your own to make as beautiful as you can imagine, guided only by the artistic mastery of the author.I saw that another individual had given this book 1 star - merely for editing on an E-Book version.  Unless every word was morphed and un-readable, I find that slightly harsh to Ms. Gruen.This is a wonderful story, that has moment's similar to the The Notebook and the movie Big Fish.  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys historical fiction and romance.  It is carefully researched and filled with drama, humor, passion and love.

Watched the film first and loved it. The book didn't disappoint either. Even though I had watched the film it was an interesting read, it didn't feel boring to read what I've already seen. The characters's good, I especially liked Walter and some other of the minor roles, the rhythm of the writing flowing and easily read. Jacob's tone and style of talking is well carried through the book. It feels like you're there. It was also fascinating to get glimpses of his current, old life. What he had become after all of the adventures, an old man forgotten by his children and family, reliving his past. It was sad, and you could understand his grumpiness.There's just something about circuses that's fascinating. It was interesting to "learn" how the circus worked in the 30s, how they travelled by train, how the hierarchy was arranged, how you lived your life in a circus.

Not once while reading this book was I emotionally hooked -- unless you count my anger at the author. For all Gruen's indepth research into circus life of the 1930s, the atmosphere of the narrative felt wrong. The dialogue sounded far too contemporary and the stage directions -- "I looked out the window"; "He moved his jaw before answering"; "I looked steadily at her then looked away"; and the dramatic "in the distance I heard the sound of a camel" -- were intrusive. Add to that the constant  cutting back and forth from young-buck Jacob to retirment-home Jacob and you feel not that you're immersed in another world, but rather reading the script of a touching Hallmark Theater production.The characters are from central casting: the good hearted whore, the tyrannical boss, the crazy husband and his sweet but long-suffering wife. And the noble hero. Young and bereft of family, Jacob stumbles into circus life and is hired as a vet. He is painted as the champion of the small and weak, regardless of sex or species, always wanting to do good and right. And yet, at the moment when his friends need him most, he's gone, taking their only means of protection, a knife, with him. And the elephant for whom he professes deep affection he leaves to the hands of a crazed maniac, to be beaten not once but twice, and our hero does nothing about it. How can we possibly cheer for him?Too bad the story wasn't told from the POV of a minor character named Greg. Greg shows up twice, first when he retrieves the elephant using what he knows she loves, booze. He shows up later ministering to her wounds from one of the beatings. He's speaking Polish to her, the language she understands. Why did we need Jacob? Sounds like we already had a vet, and a worthy hero, standing in the wings.

I was hesitant to read this book because I'm not particularly interested in the circus, however; it was a revealing inside look at how hard 'carnie' life was. It also shows how life can throw you some curve balls that completely changes the path you take. This story flowed and it was hard to put down...nice and easy to follow.

I really enjoyed this book but I don't really know why. The story was not anything extraordinary. The love story left something to be desired. Does anyone understand where exactly that came from? One minute he sees her across a crowded room and then bang!she just happens to love him too. Okay then, don't bother to really get to know each other. Some of the characters were hardly developed, Marlena mainly. There were moments I found to be quite crude and crass. However, somehow I know that years from now I will look back at this read fondly.My best guess is that I just liked the voice found throughout the novel. In fact I would go so far as to say the narration was superb. I have always been a fan of first person and while the bulk of this story is in fact first person, Gruen superbly weaves a sort of third person narration. The transitions are so smooth that you barely notice the shift. Gruen is just a superb narrator or maybe it's Jacob who does the great job?Now for a few thoughts on the film; I have four words, don't waste your time. If the narration and not the actual story is what makes the book then it is a no brainer that a movie would fall very short. This film was really not good, at least from where I was sitting. Maybe it has to do with the major lack of chemistry between Witherspoon and Pattinson?

I loved this book.  I could not put it down once I began reading it. Perhaps it's because I'm rapidly approaching the age where I could end up in a nursing home myself, but that part of the book fascinated me. It's from the perspective of a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It rang true.  I was touched by the nurse who treated him like a person, who explained things to him, and cried with him when his family failed to show up to take him to the larger-than-life event he had looked forward to throughout the book--the circus.  It made me think back over the experiences with our own parents and wish I could go back and do things differently.The other part of the book, the flashbacks into this man's history were fast-paced and exciting.  I immediately sympathized when, as a young man, he lost his parents and found himself alone in the world, and understood his running away from it all. Maybe I question the believability of one or two points while he traveled with the circus, but not enough that it marred my enjoyment of the book.  I simply took it as an indication of how much things have changed in this country over time. What would not fly now might have at one time. It opened my eyes to how easy it is to become absorbed into any society (even the world of a traveling circus)  and how to survive, a person must abide by rules they might otherwise never consider.  The book showed the higher and baser aspects of human nature, all of which I found easily believable.  The world is filled with people who have differing stories and problems.  We don't all behave the same or believe the same, but we do conform to the ethics of our individual worlds--good or bad.  I believe the author demonstrated that  beautifully.I read some of the other reviews, and was saddened that some people couldn't see past  the imperfections and simply enjoy the different facets of the story.  It's a good one.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.

The book was interesting but I think mostly because the subject matter was something different.  The characters in my opinion could have been fleshed out a lot more.  It seemed to me to be a book written primarily so a movie could be made of it.  It was more of an outline for a larger novel.  Aside from that, again, it was interesting I just thought there should be more to it.

WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is like candy for readers.  It was one of two best books I've read in the past year.  In fact, it probably ranks as one of my favorite books of all time.  It was expertly, yet simply, written by Sara Gruen.  The novel tells the story from the perspective of Jacob Jankowski who currently resides in a nursing home.  The story alternates between Jacob's current living situation and the story of his past, how he once worked in a circus during the first part of the 20th century.  The impending visit of a traveling circus next door to the nursing home prompts him to remember the details of his circus life/experiences when he was a young man.Gruen's description of the nursing home, its residents, and its day-to-day activities was spot-on.  Having visited my grandparents on several occasions in their nursing home, I could easily visualize and relate to Jacob's experiences.  It really came to life.You can tell that a lot of research was also put into the circus recollections of Jacob Jankowski.  Gruen delves into circus life in the early 20th century when circuses traveled via train from town to town, and animal welfare and regulations were little more than an afterthought.  I found all of Jankowski's experiences intriguing and actually felt like I was experiencing them right along with him.  The characterizations felt realistic, too, and I could easily distinguish between the many different circus workers, and even some of the more prominent animals.It wasn't until halfway through the novel, though, that I realized how the nursing home is a metaphor for the circus.  Gruen makes subtle comparisons between the animals in the circus and the residents of nursing home.  They're both herded, fed, and prodded.  Jacob even says, "I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person."  So true.  And sad.Now that I've read this fantastic book, I'm very eager to see the forthcoming movie adaptation.  I'd like to say that I'd love to see a sequel to this great tale; however, I think Jacob Jankowski's story has already been told in full in this one well-crafted novel.

You've heard the story about the blind man feeling an elephant and trying to describe what it is? In many ways, I felt the same way reading Sara Gruen's fast-paced and engaging story. It is an oddity. It is wondrous. And it also has some plodding, filthy elements."Water for Elephants" starts with a grippping prologue, during which we see the murder of a circus employee in the 1930s. The story then switches back and forth between young and old Jacob, a man who gets pulled into the circus life, discovers love, adventure, and trouble, and then reflects back on that as an old man. Gruen does a fine job creating this empathetic character, though the old man's story becomes less important and almost campy by the end. The young man's story delves deeply into circus life, with lots of interesting details and conflict, although the characters are all fairly black and white, with the villains being obvious and predictable. For some reason, Gruen also seems compelled to give us lurid details of the circus striptease and Jacob's own loss of virginity at the hands of the "cooch tent" prostitutes. Why these elements are described in such detail only detracts from the already shallow love story to come. It would be nice to see some intellectual dialogue between our male and female leads, rather than coy glances, "shapely calves," and the surface attraction of teenage relationships.Soon, Jacob's background in veterinary studies allows him to find a place onboard the circus train, during which he falls in love with Marlena, a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. When the circus procures a new elephant for its act, it provides a link between Jacob and Marlena, as well as with Rosie the elephant. The problem is the jealous and psychotic August, Marlena's husband. We know he must be removed from the picture for this to work. Deeply ethical and moral issues come into play, but Gruen chooses the easy route and solves the problem in a somewhat satisfactory but highly implausible way. This is only underlined by the equally implausible solution of old-man Jacob's frustrations. Sure, it's all warm and gushy, but the deep research and texture of the circus and some of its elements give way to romanticized solutions that turn a historic novel into one of borderline fantasy.With all the fanfare over this novel and tie-in movie, I suspect I'll be accused of being the blind man here in my description of the "elephant." Many elements were strong and well done, but much like Sebold's "The Lovely Bones," all of the wonderful storybuilding gives way to a conclusion that feels a bit forced and too easy.

This is one of a handful of books I haven't been able to put down easily. Finished in two sittings(!), it's the tale of an old man, reflecting on his youth as a Cornell veterinary school dropout who joins the circus after learning he has no home or family to go back to. Carefully researched, Sarah Gruen takes the reader through a traveling circus from the depression era. Many of the subplots were taken from actual recorded events, adding to the realism of the book. The characters also represented each aspect of the circus; I became concerned for the stage dwarf as much as an old tent setter. The novel also switches from the past time in the circus to the present, where the protagonist reflects on his current state in the nursing home in an often comical fashion, giving a break to the main plot line and building suspense. Highly recommended for those interested in historical novels.

Wow! Sara Gruen is a master storyteller. Her words make the often seedy yet oh-so-fascinating world behind the scenes of a legendary circus train seem so real, so here and now. The central figure of Jacob Jankowski is so well written. I am especially taken with the depiction of life in a nursing home with the body of a 93-year-old and the wit and mind of a much much younger man. It gave me a whole new perspective on how sad and depressing life must be like in an institution like that and will make me spend more time getting to know those who find their homes in such a place. But what struck me most was when I read the Afterward in which Ms. Gruen explained the motivation for writing this novel and the incredibly detailed research that she found herself doing just to put pen to paper. Not only is she so very gifted with the ease of writing, but she is very committed to the realism of details. Incredible! She took some really fascinating true stories from some of this country's most storied circuses and rolled them all into one incredible journey. I highly recommed this book to everyone I meet and I will be looking for more of her works to inspire and inform. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book today.

This book was stunning... I just couldn't get sucked into it and almost gave up until a facebook post where someone said it was one of the best books they'd ever read. I decided to give it one more try, and I'm so glad I did. It was amazing!!!

I found this book to be a very entertaining read, combining historical facts about circus life with a love relationship.  I liked the manner in which the author wrote and her vivid characters.  It wasn't a deep, complicated novel, but a good story.

Water for Elephants begins by pulling back the curtain on the inner workings of a nursing home, a man begins to speak of the adventure of life in the circus. The book reminded me once again of how much I detest nursing homes. I remember when I volunteered at a nursing home... it was so hard to shake the feeling of depression as soon as you walked in, no matter how many activities you planned. It was a sad place filled with lonely people staring out of the front doors just hoping family or friends would come visit them. Yet as you roamed the halls you could hear the most amazing stories of lives lived so fully when age did not seem to have the slightest grip. As you read Water for Elephants just like with any life there are parts which you might wish had been edited out, yet the story so clearly shines the light on a life lived fully and how society tries to shelve those it believes no longer have something of value to offer...**This book is not recommended for all ages, as it definitely contains adult material**

I could not put this book down. I absolutely loved it and have passed it on and recommended it to others to read it as well. Although it's a fictional account of a circus story, it was very believable and I was only disappointed in an unrealistic ending. I still give it five stars because everything up to the last page or two was so entertaining.

The reviews from "Booklist" and "Publisher's Weekly" are a little misleading--the book really is more uplifting and not as depressing as the plot elements they have focused upon.  This story leads the reader into the rich and complex world of traveling circuses, circa 1930's.  The journey of the young man reminded me of Clyde Griffiths in Theodore Dreiser's, "An American Tragedy", the relationship between Marlena and August reminded me of the dynamics between Sophie and Nathan in William Styron's, "Sophie's Choice".  But, in spite of these analogies, the book still isn't depressing!  A good summer read, you won't be disappointed.

I had a vague idea of what this book was about before I read it and I was in for a nice surprise. The author paints a wonderful picture of circus life and life on the road. More than that she created a compelling love story that moved the story along quickly and almost effortlessly. It was easy to get lost in the ups and downs of this world and I had a hard time coming back to reality. This is a definite must read.

This was a really good, enjoyable, authentic, endearing book.  Thoroughly enjoyable read.  One of a kind, leaves you wanting more of the circus on the rails of the depression era. I also love first-person novels that stay on plot and Gruen doesn't disappoint there.I TOTALLY disagree with another reviewer who said Gruen over-anthropomophized and over-romanticized the animals in the story! Hardly. If anything, if Jacob is a vet, we read very little of him doing his job in context of the story.  And anyone who's around animals or has worked with animals can hardly fail to form emotional attachments to them.When I finished WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, I like I felt when I finished reading FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE and SEABISCUIT.

A remarkably fast read,leaving the reader breathless from tight action and tingling suspense.  This book reveals the glitz and sparkle of the circus, along with its dark and terrible underside that lurks barely out of sight.  The two time frames - of old Jacob and young Jacob - are carried through smoothly by Gruen, who ties the events together  with skillful repetition of words and phrases.  I wish there were more novels that take place during the Depression - an era that had such enormous impact on our society and continues to reverberate in modern times.  This book did not make me want to run away and join a circus.  It did make me happy that movements toward animal-less circuses have made a toehold.

I had some idea of the content of this book before I started reading, but was extremely impressed with the author's skill in opening the world of the Depression-Era circus, and the fascinating people who populated it.  Her ability to shift between the poignant situation of the aged Jacob, and the youthful enthusiasm and passion of the youthful Jacob made this novel 'work' better than most I've read in years.  The ending did catch me by surprise, and was absolutely delightful in all respects.  I will commend this book to the attention of anyone who wants to look through a window on the past, and the believable people who occupied that world -- told in the words of a very gifted author.

It is the present day. An old man, either 90 or 93 - he can't recall - lives in a desultory, grumpy funk in a generic nursing home, treated like a product, given impersonal but efficient care, and regularly visited by a vaguely attentive, dutifully loving, but clueless family. He is lonely; he misses his wife; he longs for attention from his prolific family, but understands that they have problems of their own. For solace, he relives his early life on a continuous thread - his life as a circus veterinarian for a second-rate travelling show.In alternating chapters, the author, Sara Gruen, takes us from the present to 1931 and back, showing us a rich history of a good young man whose life is changed forever when his parents die in a car crash, leaving him destitute just as he is to stand for his final exams at Cornell. He had hoped to go into practice with his father as a small-town vet; instead, at a total loss, he bolts, jumping a train which turns out to belong to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth (or words to that effect). He is plunged into the colourful, quirky world of the circus, with all its different intensities and personalities; at risk of being summarily thrown off the train, he is reprieved by Uncle Al, the owner/operator/ringleader of the circus when that gentleman learns that Jacob is - for all intents and purposes - a vet, something Uncle Al has coveted for a long time.Jacob falls easily into the life, loving working with the animals, learning to become one of the circus family, and finding an unlikely friend in the dwarf whose living space he shares. Along the way, and almost immediately, he also falls hopelessly in love with the wife of Uncle Al's right-hand man August. Marlena is the woman of the horses, directing her own act with 12 beautiful Arabians in the ring, and her grace and beauty completely captures Jacob. He must tread carefully; her husband, August, is borderline insane and insanely jealous.The old Jacob buries himself in these memories, frets over the static life of the nursing home, and learns to look for one particular nurse who seems to be the only person who really takes an interest in him. She counsels him gently; she brings him food that is just a little better than what he's been getting; and we get a glimpse, through his eyes, of the frustration of the elderly, trapped inside a body that won't cooperate anymore and surrounded by people who aren't interested in his bright former life.This was an absorbing, entertaining book, a complete joy. Well-written, well-researched, it opens a door on a world that most people never thought about and makes the different subjects into real people. It also made me feel empathy toward those in impersonal facilities, who live for a familiar, interested face, and who long to impart to us the lives they led. I could not put this book down. Highly recommended.

I can't believe it took me this long to pick this book up.  What a great story and very well written.  I always enjoy books that go back and forth between past & present, and the author did it brilliantly.The only thing I disliked was reading about the treatment of the animals, but that is to be expected with a circus story.Would definitely recommend this book to a friend.  I'm sure the upcoming move won't do the book justice, but will at the very least draw some new readers.

Sarah Gruen clearly establishes and proves her research of traveling circuses in the 1920s and 30s in this novel. Written from the point of view of the protagonist, Jacob Jankowski, we find out how he is thrust into the world of circuses after he experiences a life-changing tragedy in his family, the death of his parents in an accident. The book goes back and forth from the present, with Jacob being in an assisted-living home, to the past, where Jacob boards a train and then, after being almost booted off, begins his world of traveling circuses aboard the Benzini Bros. With nowhere to go, and nothing to do, he begins the circus life, meets several of the key characters, such as Walter, Camel, Marlena, August and "Uncle Al." While Gruen's ability as a storyteller is there, I felt like the book was a letdown because of the direction it took with the main character.One substantial element to Jacob's personality is his connection and compassion for animals, but I felt like there were times when he isn't the strong leading character he could be, and that this compassion for animals is inconsistent. For instance, there is a point after becoming the Benzini Bros. personal veterinarian, he indicates that his protection for animals is unbending saying "...and what my father would do--what my father would want me to do--is look after them, and I am filled with that absolute and unwavering conviction." Yet, there is at least one instance when Jacob has a chance to stop the villain August from abusing Rosie, the elephant, but fails to take any action, despite how ruthless he knows August to be. Odd, considering that he makes some rash decisions, but none that are of much consequence.It also seemed odd to not focus more on the circus itself, as it pertained to Jacob and many of the other characters. Why not focus more on the spectacle of the circus, the performers, the competition between the rival circuses, and the pageantry of the event?  The potential to do this seemed to be there, especially the way the 93 year old Jacob reflects on the sweet memories of being in the circus, telling many workers in the hospital about those wonderful days with teary-eyed conviction.  Instead Gruen uses much of the book's energy on the "forced" relationship and wooden love affair between Jacob and leading circus performer Marlena, August's wife. I mean, if you are going to write about the circus, and do the research on it, why not concentrate more attention on events that involve the history of the circus. There was a pronounced shift to the love affair between Jacob and Marlena, especially in the novel's second half, and much of the dialogue between the two seemed hokey and silly. It made the book come across as a romance disguised as a circus story.Still, it was an enjoyable and relatively quick read. Gruen's ability to detail scenery and hook the reader into a story is present from the beginning to end and her writing flows smoothly. This is the kind of book that has many redeeming qualities, and makes for a good topic of discussion.I just wish the book wouldn't have "sold out" on a silly love affair; the potential for much more was there.3 1/2 stars

It's been a long time since a novel about circus life has been published, and this excellent book certainly makes up for all of those missing years. It is a well told tale that is, in part, humorous, tragic, romantic and heartbreaking. The book uses the same narrative device as "Little Big Man", that is, a very old gentleman remembering the exciting and adventurous days of his youth, and the circus he accidentally joined. The characters are extremely well drawn, even the minor ones, and I'm sure that the author spend many days delving into circus lore to get the details correct. Being of Polish descent, I enjoyed the fact that the protagonist was Polish, and I was taken back to my grade school days when a character began reciting the "Our Father" in Polish! It amazed me that, after all of these years, I could still read and pronounce those words correctly. This is simply a wonderful novel, and I highly recommend it!

It's not often that a book leaves me cheering out loud, but WATER FOR ELEPHANTS did just that.Packed with delightfully-unfolded information about depression-era circuses, this book is more than a history of the big top and most definitely more than a mere boy-meets-girl story.For a young man, the glamor of running away to join a circus isn't really all that glamourous after all. Gruen shows the seedy side of the big top, the desperate times of the depression, the multilayered personalities of performers, roustabouts, owners, and even the animals, and balances it all delicately with the memories of an old man in an assisted living facility.I loved the way the title tied in to the story. No one, apparently, carries water for elephants, since elephants drink far too much. But in our memories - perhaps we all believe we have carried water for our own private elephants.I admit I read it twice in a week - inhaling it the first time, savoring it the second (particularly the ending). Tasty indeed, and five-star all the way.

I get the creeps when I think of circuses from the mid 1900's. That was one of the reasons I put off reading this book even though I bought it quite some time ago. Eventually I just had no more unread books left and too long for my paycheck to arrive. I picked it up and barely put it down. I really got me hooked from the start and despite my despise of circuses I really liked it. I do think Gruen could have made Marlena more alive in the story. To me, she was just a beautiful girl. Her character never seemed to gain any life. But I especially cared for Jacob and the looking back of the old Jacob. It got me thinking of life, nursery homes and love.  You might even say it moved me. It didn't cure me though - circuses still gives me the creeps!

I remember when Cecil B. Demille directed a behemoth circus film called "The Greatest Show On Earth" in the early 50's.  It had such spectacle, and what a star-studded cast headed by the great Jimmy Stewart, Cornel Wilde, Betty Hutton...it was, just, well, awful.  Yes, AWFUL.  And ya know, Hollywood decided to give this giant piece of piffle the year's BEST PICTURE Oscar.  I mean, it really makes you wonder why people (uh, powerful people, that is), go to the trouble of praising something that's not worth the price of admission.  Could it be....to make the film more profitable???  Could it be....money, money, and hopefully more money????  To gush and fawn over something so abysmal, luring the public into conforming to the propogandic publicity, that it finally becomes a pseudo-masterpiece, not to be missed?Know what I mean?Because if you don't, then borrow (DON"T BUY!!), Sara Gruen's Best-selling monkey-poop called "Water For Elephants".  This is a book that may give the beginning writer hope and much needed optimism.  Repeat after me...."If Sara Gruen can be a published writer, then I can be a published writer".  It's so easy you don't even have to develope characters to any great extent, as long as you have a skeletal outline of your story, just scribble it down and then decorate with some tacky sex so it doesn't fall into the children's market.  Make sure the story is narrated too, but make sure it's just about as pretentious a narration as you can dream up.  Then populate the text with various freaky deaky characters and situations....like animal torture and alcoholism.  Then let the 'big boys' market it for you and wait for the film, that will hopefully have an all-female cast.  I mean, who cares?

After watching the movie (which I liked), my sister gave me the book. I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals. Taking care of the animals makes him happy, and that is how he met Marlena. Beautiful, fragile, but married.I really liked this book. I loved how the author described life at the circus. It's obvious she investigated about circus, the people who worked at them, how they function, and their animals.But what I liked more was the writing. The story is told by old Jacob. He's 90 years old, or 93, and his memories about the circus, his wife and his life don't die. He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning. Although I wanted more emotion between Marlena and Jacob, it's a romantic story, full of action, love for animals and a magnificent circus.

We can read in an author's note that Sara Gruen has studied elephant behavior.  She has more than studied it she has affectingly captured it in Rosie, a large gray elephant and the one hope of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a down at the heels circus trying to make a go of it during the Depression.Now, Rosie wasn't too much of a hope because she was lovable but could not follow any command .  Rosie's only unique characteristic was a seemingly unquenchable thirst for  lemonade.  Her inability to perform was no excuse for the intolerable cruelty visited upon her by August, the callous menagerie director who thought nothing of tossing a lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth.  He didn't limit his abuse to helpless animals but also mistreated his lovely wife, Marlena.Spellbindingly read by David LeDoux and John Rutledge Jones, Water For Elephants is at its heart the story of three - Jacob, who has lost his parents in a tragic accident, and finds a home with the circus, Marlena and, of course, Rosie.  It's a poignant look at their lives set against an oppressive, sometimes degrading circus world, and a look back at our country during the grueling Depression years.  Most importantly, it's a reminder of the resiliency of human beings and how love can heal.- Gail Cooke

I picked this book up by chance at the bookstore. I was interested at once in the subject and the characters. I know nothing about the circus and was captivated by the descriptions of depression era circuses. This was all new territory for me and to find out in the notes at the end that all this information was based on fact was exciting.I loved having each chapter start with a picture from the Ringling Brothers circus archives. I wasso happy at the ending, I truly did not see it coming. Such a feel good story. I have recommended it to many of my friends, including my book club. Try it, you will like it.

The books feels like the author was writing it while she was running on the treadmill, sometimes things speed up so quickly you can tell the author just got really sick of the segment and wanted to move on with the storyline. It renders the main romance somewhat rushed and insincere, at least that's how I felt. Characters who have known each other for a very short time share passion and requited love for one another, vowing to be together forever when one of whom is still married.Some details like the villain being Jewish are completely impertinent to the story but makes you why exactly the author did that. The protagonist is lovable and portrayed in very positive light throughout the novel, but his actions are just as villainous and psychotic. At one point where the protagonist gets really jealous he climbs on the roof of a moving train while carrying a knife in his mouth, intending to kill the villain in a very really Indiana Joneseque segment that makes you giggle at how superficial the author's line of thought was.Without revealing too much, it's very close to Moulin Rouge, only without the interest, tempestuous music and theatricality. If you enjoy sappy romance novels you'll like it.

These days, whenever I see that a novel is being made into a movie, I assume that it must be at least somewhat decent.  With the recent release of the movie, I decided to pull my copy on loan from my bookshelf and read it before venturing out to the theater to see the movie (or, more likely now, renting it).Water for Elephants is definitely different from the other fiction I normally read.  The book takes place after the Great Depression, and Gruen did a lot of research surrounding circuses during that time to influence her book.  Many of the chapters began with a picture from circus archives, which really added to the experience of reading the book.  I absolutely loved how the chapters alternated between the main character's experience in his early 20's as the circus veterinarian and as a 93-year-old man in a nursing home.  It really made me think about the stories of my own grandparents, who are nearing their 90's themselves.The diverse cast of characters in the circus also made the drama of circus life a fascinating read.  I had no idea of the caste system in circus life, the treatment of employees and animals alike, and how competitive circus troupes were during this challenging era in U.S. history.I have heard that the book is better than the movie.  I admit that I am a bit skeptical about the movie given some of the casting choices for its main characters.  But, like any avid book lover, I do intend to see the movie to see how it compares to one of the best books I've read so far this year.  I highly recommend this book for those who want a story with adventure, romance, and excitement under the big top.

Sara Gruen's novel, Water for Elephants, published in 2007 by Algonquin Books is a good story about a circus traveling in the U.S. during the Great Depression. The narrative carries the novel in spite of the rather shallow character development. Gruen's description of the historical period is sketchy with a few interesting threads. I bought the book because I was limited in free time and could only read in brief intermittent time periods. The book required minimal attention and was entertaining. I wonder about the editing of the book, allowing contemporary jargon to slip into the 1930's dialogue (e.g., "Whatever"). Water for Elephants is a light, beach, plane, motel novel that I recommend for the casual reader.

Water for Elephants is fundamentally a love story, set in the almost magic world of the circus, laid bare in all its savagery. Told in retrospect, by a now aging protagonist, it is overlaid with an uncomfortable insight into life in a nursing home. Sarah Gruen does a wonderful job, speaking convincingly as both young and old. Her detail is a work of art in itself as it transports us solidly into yesteryear.

A very unusual book. I couldn't put it down. It gives an insight to circus life in the days when they travelled by train. It is written through the eyes of a young lad who traumatised by the death of his parents was unable to complete his final exam to become a vet and accidentally joins the circus. The characters and the animals are all very real. Some you love and some you hate (never the animals. Anyone who loves circuses and remembers (or would like to know) how they used to be will love this book.

A beautiful yet disconnected young woman and her gregarious alpha male husband befriend and uplift a lonely young intellectual.  The climax confrontation and subsequent revelation of the true nature of the husband's problems are blatant plagiarisms.  But the thing that tipped me off early on wasn't the love triangle.  It was instead when a character named Kinko is mistakenly referred to as "stinko".  You may recall Meryl Streep doing the same thing when referring to Stingo.  Unfortuantely for fans of this book, the alpha male character, August, has none of the charms of Kevin Kline.Yet for all its faults I did enjoy the book.  It was very hard to put down, but that may be because the circus is a favorite subject of mine.

This story is lovely and you cannot put it down. I read every word from cover to cover. There are also authors notes, an interview with Sara Gruen, and questions for book group discussions.Now back to my title for review. So many of you gave the story away you should not rethink your reviews. Thank G-d, I had already chose to read this book when I read Riding Lessons. I had never read one review on this book before I bought it. I wonder what goody Sara has for us next. It will be fun as long as I stay away from reviews!

I picked this up from the library's Best Seller rack with a little doubt about whether I would enjoy it or not.  Was I surprised!!! This is one of the most enjoyable novels I've ever read.  I couldn't put it down.  It contained romance, mystery, history, suspense, comedy, drama, and tragedy all in one story.  I went through a gamut of emotions reading this and thoroughly enjoyed the ending.

He's 90 or 93 he doesn't really remember and it doesn't really matter anyway because according to Jacob's nothing really matters after a few years in an old folks home.  His bitter and sarcastic exterior conceals a deep pain and the certain knowledge that the better years of his life have passed by.  As Citizen Kane says old age is the only disease that no one wants to be cured of.Things weren't always this way Jacob was young once until an unfortunate series of circumstances ended his hopes of being a vet forever.  He is then taken on a journey across the country with a circus it is a fun little book and well worse the trip.  The characters have life and everything that fictional characters should have.  You'll find it to be so good that even though you can see the ending coming from three miles away you will not even care.Overall-It is rare that I run across a book this good

I don't think the actual plot of this story interested me as much as the incredible setting and description of circus life in the early 1900's. I LOVE the historic photographs at the end of each chapter because it allowed me to see for myself the life-style that the story was trying to re-create. I wasn't all that attached to any of the human characters, but I loved the animals and actually think my favourite character was the Circus itself. I was able to view the Circus as a living, breathing character of it's own, and that is honestly where most of my intrigue for the story came from. I was not prepared for the amount of sexuality and language in the story! It was completely distracting from the story and I was disappointed how often it would randomly be thrown into the writing. I felt it was almost always unnecessary...it did more to detract from the novel than it ever could have added. I suppose it was a wake-up call for me about the difference between young adult fiction and adult fiction. Had it not been for those two things I would have definitely rated the book a 4 or 5.

The idea of running away with the circus definitely appeals sometimes - especially when your own life has turned into one - but Gruen's gritty, real account of that life is enough to make me tuck in and contain my self to watching Cirque on tv. Scariest part about it is that I know it's based on the truth - not the story, but the time. She did great research on travelling circuses.The romance was gorgeous. And while I refuse to give out spoilers, I will tell you that she surprised me. I was sure the romantic outcome was going to come out one way and she made the change beautifully.The ending? Maybe a little saccharin, but why not? You can't leave the circus without candy floss.

"Life is the best show on earth"I have never read a book about the circus - or even gone to a circus for that matter. Yet, reading this book through Jacob Jankowsi's memories, I feel like I know what goes on like I've been many times before."I don't talk much about those days. Never did. I don't know why - I worked on circuses for nearly seven years, and if that isn't a fodder for conversation, I don't know what is."There is so much that happens in Water for Elephants, from the point where Jacob discovers his parents are dead and flunks his veterinary exam to the point he runs away to the circus (and unknowingly at that). Soon he discovers that the circus has so much to offer, and it's own perils as well. When he meets Marlena and begins developing feelings for her, he finds himself standing on thin ice with her husband August, and when things begin to turn sour it seems he's not the only one out to get him."I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other."But there's another side to this story - the Mr. Jankowski who lives in the nursing home after the rest of his family seems to have forgotten about him. The man who doesn't quite remember how old he is. Who doesn't like the 'food' (if you can call it that). The man who still remembers his days at The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.The story was well crafted and encompassed all the different elements of life in the circus. Some actual photographs found at the beginning of each chapter added to the 'realness' of the plot and make the whole store seem even more realistic. Similarly, the characters were well developed, and the patriarchal hierarchy of circus performers vs. workmen was explored also. I loved to see how Marlena became a stronger character throughout the novel, eventually taking a definite stand against her mentally instable husband. And Jacob? Well, during the whole story he was there to learn the ropes and was always there to stand for what was right - for the animals he treated and the people he became friends with.*CONCLUSION*Overall, I really enjoyed Water for Elephants. I felt completely immersed in the circus lifestyle and was always desperately wanting to flick through the pages and find out what was happening next. Next on my list is to see the movie and see how it compares.

I'm not sure what to say about this book.  I enjoyed it - it's a cute little historical fiction - but it wasn't fantastic.  just a few random thoughts on the book:* The most interesting character was Walter the dwarf clown and he had a very limited role.* Jacob, the narrator I liked more as a 93yo than as a 23yo, and I never really felt the connection between him and Marlena.* The grime of the circus itself was part of what kept me sucked in - that was brilliantly described.* In the end, I felt a great deal of sympathy for August - he wasn't a good man by any means, but he also was fighting some serious demons.Like I said, I liked the book but I don't feel I need to run out and watch the movie now ....

i enjoyed reading this book. Although it will not go down in the ranks of a great American Classic, it is still agood read. There was a feeling for the desperation of the period, and the atypical lives of the circus. Some of the characterizations were a bit shallow and somewhat predictable, the plot manages to keep the reader engaged. I enjoyed the contrasting chapters of the young protagonist and his later, elderly self. The ending is sweet, but quite unplausible. All of these things considered, I still gave this book an overall 4 rating.

I have just started reading again and I decided this would be my first book in years.I was not disappointed as the author paints a vivid picture of the characters with an adequate storyline.  If you are looking for large adventures in the Circus, then this book is probably not for you.. but if you are interested in a good read with some very interesting characters, then I recommend it.It brings you into a world that you likely never knew existed.

This has become a must read with so many favorable reviews I kept looking forward to being captured by it.  It really is two stories in one book.  The old man's story is wonderful.  My father resides in a residency care facility and the insights of the old man made me think about what my father is facing.  The loss of dignity and the battling soul struck home.In my view the main story was only fair.  The story seemed to be telegraphed and I could not get my self terribly interested.

On the simplest level, all I can say is that it didn't amuse me and I couldn't force myself to finish it. But I'm a "hard sell" for fiction, and I can see by the other reviews that many people loved it. Lucky them!On a slightly more analytic level, I'd say that what prevented me from enjoying the book was the "voice" of the narrator, who is supposed to be a man in his nineties remembering his youth in the circus. I'm a man approaching seventy, with some circus experiences as a teenager in Iowa and as the father of a circus acrobat in the Cirque de Soleil era. I found the "voice" of the narrator unconvincing, extremely unconvincing, as a male of the species and as a male American of the 1930s and 1940s. I couldn't get past that central implausibility. I found myself scoffing at the sensibilities of the pseudo-male narrator at every emotional turn of this quite melodramatic novel.

I could not have loved it more. Water for Elephants is one of those wonderful novels that has an interesting setting, but it doesn't let the setting take over the story. It is a novel about the people in that place, and the people of Benzini's circus took over my mind and stay with me still.Jacob begins Water for Elephants alone. Orphaned by his immigrant parents, he is weeks away from his Cornell graduation, but he simply cannot return to the life he has known. He jumps aboard a moving train-the train carrying the Benzini circus to its next production. No one on the circus cares that Jacob didn't finish his final exams. The diploma, he is told, "is just a piece of paper, and nobody here gives a damn about that. You're on a show now. The rules are different."In fact, the circus seems to have no rules at all. Jacob somehow finds other kind souls among the misfits, and these people work together to protect themselves and the animals. The villians-Uncle Al and August-are well described and three-dimensional. You understand why they behave the way they do. These villians are not cookie-cutter images, and their real-world sensibilities make them even more frightening.

As most previous reviewers have said, this is a rich tale of circus life in the '30's. The protaganist, Jacob, is appealing with personality and real human emotion. I feel the author Ms. Gruen has well-researched everything-circus in writing this book.I felt while reading this book I was actually seeing what transpired in my mind's eye-I could see the rough characters come alive and could smell the sawdust, cookin grease, animals and popcorn. I felt what the characters felt when they fell upon hard times. This book also opened my eyes regarding how a rough slice of life a small circus can be.Bring on the circus parade!

I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The remembrances of an old man of his time in a piece of Americana, the travelling circus. Sara Gruen makes us feel the excitement of the Big Top, the pain, sadness and joy of the people in it, and conveys the dire circumstances of the Great Depression so you can almost taste the dust. I wanted to hurt some of the characters and hug others. The ending is divine.

Water for Elephants is about an old man at the end of his days reflecting upon his life and the events that lead him to run away and join the circus right before he finishes college.  His story goes back and forth between his modern day stay at a nursing home and his days in his early 20s during the Great Depression traveling around the country with the Great Benzini Brothers Circus.Sara Gruen does a phenomenal job of painting a vivid portrait of Depression era America and of the end of the golden age of circus life in the USA.  The Photos that head each chapter are fun little bonuses that let you see the actual performers of this time as well as some of the settings in which the book takes place.The characters come to life and are vivid portrayals of heroes and villians.  The relationships formed amongst all the characters are memorable and keep you wanting more.  A page turner that does a good job of keeping you interested by flipping back and forth between past and present.5 star recommendation.

I am not a big fan of books on tape.  My husband is...on long trips we listen. If you dont mind listening to an old man with wet phlegm in his throat for hours ...go for it.  Since I picked this tape based on the reviews from Amazon I suffered through 5 dvd's so far. The story is not interesting or enlightening. A bad story can be read thru rather quickly but on tape listening at a horribly slow pace....well  ...it is like water torture.

I don't consider myself a lit-snob by any means. I love fun, breezy reads like many readers out there. I have read `em high and... low. There are times when I just want an escapist read. But given the perimeters--those reads usually deliver the goods. Though the stories may be a tad simple.Here we have a book that's been out a while. Supposedly one with some substance. So we have a guy who winds up joining the circus after ditching an Ivy league education in the Depression years.  I can go with it. No problem there. But then we have the host of characters in the circus itself. Some of this is good reading--but then--we have problems of cliched, predicatable writing wedged between sections of rather better-than-average writing. And all too many flat characters with little substance.Much of this appears in this story. That's the problem. Besides, Jacob is just not all that engaging to me or a convincing character. And the story comes off predictable and rather weak. So it's a passable beach read.Given the kind of over-the-top and unsubstantiated praise this novel has received, surely, I can't be the only one who feels this way and I can't help but notice than whenever there is a unfavorable review of this book  there will be an outpouring of five star reviews--one after another--that are all two or three sentences of praise and little real commentary.Coincidence?Again, not an altogether bad read, but this is no KITE RUNNER or actually, SNOW FLOWER AND THE SECRET FAN, two far better reads than this.

I come here to write this review, of course, "very late"....and so, perhaps many will not read what I have to say about this book.Being an avid reader, with interests all over the "map" so to speak, I have read God-Knows-How-Many stories in my 62+ years. Some deeply moving, others barely creating or leaving the slightest ripple in my conscious brain. Some, seemingly, with the power to change the way I see things or think about things...sometimes subtly, and in others there are major thought differences after finishing the book. This book has affected me deeply.The last book to touch me this way was some months back when I read "The Piano Shop on the Left Bank" by Thad CarhartThe Piano Shop on the Left Bank: Discovering a Forgotten Passion in a Paris Atelierwhich I heartily recommend to you.With "Water for Elephants" Sara Gruen creates the long-forgotten days of the Train Circus, and all that life entailed in those days...from the impossible "set-ups", "knock-downs", and in many cases "hasty retreats" from any particular chosen town before the authorities arrived upon the scene."Hard Luck Days" certainly would be a fitting genre to place this awesome story into. And, of course, with the depression, etc., they truly were hard luck days, for everyone involved with the exception of perhaps Uncle Al with his penchant for stealing, skimming, using and abusing everyone on the show. We also come to know August and his sickness that continually creates misery and unhappiness both for him, and also for those closest to him. There is Marlena, August's wife and performing partner with her performing horses, and later her act with Rosie the Elephant (a charming, and all-knowing wonderful beast if ever there was one). There are dozens and dozens of other characters, distributed throughout all levels of the show, from performers right on down to the dung-shovelers and the guys who do nothing but put up and take down the tents for the big top, day in and day out endlessly, working like dogs for sometimes nothing. We meet the midget clown Kinko also known as Walter and are shown into his rather twisted life, and also we meet Camel, an unfortunate, for sure, addicted to and dying from Jamaican ginger paralysis, a common and cruel death from drinking bad alcohol. We meet and deal with the sadistic Blackie, and witness his ways with dealing with those "done with" on the traveling show.Sara Gruen has created a most wonderfully "real" environment and "time" for this story to inhabit, one that clearly allows one to "see", "feel", "smell" and "witness" at what seems "first hand" how life was for those who lived "the Big Top life"....a marvelous talent for a writer. If she were never to write another story, this one, surely, would guarantee her a place in the literary hall of fame....a beautiful, touching, funny, serious, deeply moving look at circus life in the 30's, and also a peek today into Jacob Jankowski's life as it is, and luckily, also, what it is about to become again.Truly, this is one of the Finest books that I have had the pleasure to read....a Perfect 10!Incidentally, Sara Gruen's new book is coming out within a couple weeks, titled "Ape House". Luckily I received an advance copy from the Vine Program to read and review, and I will be starting it just as soon as I finish here with this review of "Water for Elephants".Sara Gruen....You may never read this, but I wish to Thank You, personally, for giving us this truly Lovely, Wonderfully Entertaining book. It is a true gem.~operabruin***Also, for those who may be interested to know, this wonderful book is currently being filmed for its theatrical movie release sometime in 2011.....there's NO DOUBT that I'll be there on it's Opening Night!

This is an engaging, fast paced story of a veterinarian in a circus during Prohibition.  The plot tension is well-handled and intense.  There is plenty of likeable characters, as well as villains.  And, of course, animals.  It is well-researched, and the setting (circus train stopping in many towns) is realistic, as are the many details of circus life.  I'd thought of circus culture as highly cohesive, but this novel showed serious social stratification.  The characterization is about that of the best genre fiction, though the book isn't genre.  The ending is a bit of a stretch, but a positive one.  The book was hard to put down.  An excellent read.

I usually don't read mass market, best selling paperbacks written by women. Nothing wrong with women writers I just don't read them. A friend at work asked if I wanted to read this book and her previous recs were mostly good.I really enjoyed this story. It was a nice change of pace.If you are a guy read this book cause you then have opportunity to see: What girls want in a man and why girls act like they do. That seems like a blanket statement but being a guy I would not have done many things the hero did and I couldn't understand why he thought what he did and was so against sound advice til I realized the author was a women and she was trying to write from a guys perspective. Of course what I have written may not be true and there are surely arguments against but I think I am right.I think you should read this book and am looking forward to the movie

This book was so well researched, that you are transported effortlessly  back in time with Jacob .  Upon learning that most of the incidents in the book are true, just makes this already incredible book all the more awe inspiring. It is impossible not to get caught up in Jacob's life with the circus.  The characters he encounters during his circus days are so real sometimes you think you can actually smell them, but it's his relationship with the animals, especially Rosie the elephant, that particularly touch your heart.  You won't easily forget Rosie and you'll be glad when Jacob can't either.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.  I am so glad I was packed and ready.

I felt I approached the book without prejudice as I started reading.An interesting setting and era sets this book apart from other light summer reads.  I felt it was a bit underwhelming given all the 5-star Amazon reviews it received.  I didn't completely engage with the protagonist, Jacob Jankowski, although some of the other side characters were quite well-drawn (Kinko/Walter, Camel & Uncle Al come to mind).I liked the use of flashbacks from the ageing Jacob, but the romance was a bit  facile and predictable.  And I did think of the "Sophie's Choice" love triangle before reading it here in other reviews.I liked all the bits about the circus workers, animals and the process of putting on the show.  Otherwise, I felt it was a good story written in an okay style.  I probably just expected more after all the rave reviews it got.

I am certain that there are [still] those out there who, like me, had not yet read this novel because it centers around a circus.  Do yourselves a favor, like me, and take this excellent journey with this gifted author.  Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a very moving story about relationships and family.  When Jacob Jankowski loses his family, he actually joins the circus.  Not because he wanted to, but because it presented itself.  Fortuantely, Jacob was studying to become a veterinarian and the circus was full of animals.  The story is told from the perspective of Jacob as an elderly man and Jacob as a young man.The relationships that Jacob forms during this excellent novel form the corserstone of the story.  I found myself caring about a grouchy dwarf and his 3-legged dog, as well as an elephant, and a cast of numerous colorful characters.  The evocative descriptions of the circus itself - the Benzini Brothers; a wannabee Ringling Brothers - during the Depression; actually put you on a railcar with the smell of dust all around you.  This is certainly no glamorous lifestyle, and Gruen does an exceptional job of providing vivid imagery.  The menagerie that Jacob helps care for are an important piece of this wide ranging cast that features individuals that are easy to hate and aome that are easy to love.  Jacob meets Marlena, who is married to the evil August, and the relationships that ensue become increasingly complicated.I now know more about circuses that I ever knew I wanted to.  I am glad that I do, because the learning was all part of the great fun to be had here.  This is a very entertaining and compelling book.  I could not read it fast enough, yet I felt myself wanting to slow down to enjoy it all the more.  I rate this a highly recommended 5 stars.  Enjoy!

I read a lot of nonfiction and most of the fiction I read is mysteries, instead of "literature" novels. So when "Water For Elephants" was loaned to me with a recommendation, I put off reading it. The movie, which I didn't see, got underwhelming reviews, which made me postpone it further. I think I read two new mysteries before finally picking up this book.And then was I surprised.  I loved it! It is imaginative and takes me into the wonderfully described world of a 1930's third-rate train (traveling) circus. If this world seems a little grungy, I remind myself that at the beginning of the 1930's, only 10% of rural homes had electricity for hot water heaters.  Animal rights?  Nonexistent. Workers' rights? Taking its first baby steps.  Occupational safety - don't make me laugh.  Bigotry?  How can fiction be worse than the truth. And over it all, the Great Depression, with it's unrelenting desperation.And these are illustrated in a heckofa story. The plot doesn't just advance, it gallops, it whoops. It has romance, but not implausible romance. Jacob Jankowski is the protagonist, telling the story, with a great last-minute twist, in flashbacks that I thought were handled well. As a matter of fact, the only part of the story that was too unrealistic for me was Jacob's rush to run away from all he knew - to literally, though unintentionally, run away to join the circus. And there he meets Marlena, a circus star with her trained horse team, and Augustus, her equal parts charismatic and brutal husband.I very much recommend this novel. I'm going to have to buy my own copy!

I sure am glad I never ran away to join the Circus. Reading this book I discovered it is avery Hard Life. However I did like how the story went back and forth from the present to the past. I really felt bad for the animals,especially the Elephant.I got very fond of some of the characters. Felt like I was going through their Happy and Sad times. Sara is a good story teller,she kept my interest throughout the whole book.

I am your casual reader. I read no more than ten books a year. This was the second book I read this year and so far, it's the best book I've read this year but it isn't as good as the reviews say it is. I enjoyed the bits about the old man's life more than I did than when he talked about his youth. Left lurching in an oldage home, this man tries to fend for himself when he's made to sit with a fellow gentleman he doesn't quite like. The only thing the old man knows is that he's old and even goes as far as wishing that the reader never gets to this age. The introduction of the novel is very good and it's easy to read although at times when he's reminiscing, you may get confused. The names of animals and humans can be a tad confusing. This book is a good bet for some while I can think of some people not liking this.Fellow casual readers, you're not missing much, try Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. However, for those with piqued interests, you must be wondering why your friends never spoke about this book, I wondered so too, only until I finished reading the book. I think people are liking it more because of how compact it is in encompassing two lives. The author's youthful days are nothing like mine.P.S - I, in not one way, undermine the collective intelligence of a casual reader for I am one.Applause,please.

Definitely worth reading. It offers a great look at life in an on-the-road circus, but it also provides a good look at what goes on in the mind of a 90-something who has seen and lived a lot, but who believes he has been put out to pasture.I would have given the book probably five stars if it hadn't contained so much profanity and scatological language.  The old man's tale would have done a very good job of living on its own without that.

As a person in his 70s who deals with a mother-in-law in her 90s, I found much Jacob's trials in the nursing home close to home. That he could escape into the memory of his youthful connection with the circus was probably a life saver for him.Ms Gruen did a masterful job of separating and at the same time blending Jacob's experiences in his youth with those in his present state of being 90 or 93.It is worth reading this book all the way through to get to a surprising and wonderful end that I shall not reveal so as not to spoil it for others.Ms Gruen obviously researched circuses. Her attention to detail, both when she wrote about the circus and also when she wrote about the nursing home helped make the story realistic.All in all, it was well written and held my attention.

I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially after seeing the previews for the upcoming movie.  I must say that it is one of the worst books I have ever read and I have been an avid reader my entire life.  I couldn't relate or get attached to the main character, Jacob, except at certain points when he was elderly.  I actually felt very embarrassed for the author while reading the many squalor erotica scenes that did nothing to help me connect or care for any of the characters.  I was expecting a heartfelt romance, but the characters, including the love interest, Marlena, are so one dimensional that I found the whole thing absurd and unbelievable.  I kept trying to get into it and hoped it would get better as it went along, but no such luck.  If you must read it, try to borrow it instead of buying or see if you can pick up a cheap copy at a thrift store.  Better yet, spend your time reading something with a convincing story and engaging characters instead.

Even people who say "I only read nonfiction" can enjoy this entertaining novel, which is rich with fascinating details about life in a traveling circus during Prohibition and the Depression. For example, circus members stocked up on booze in Canada and sneaked it across the border into the US  by storing it in the middle of the train car carrying camels, because camels spit, and customs agents didn't want to mingle with them. Against an unusual background, the fictional characters (humans and other animals) weave a story that keeps readers turning the pages.

For months, everytime I was in a bookstore - I found that I would gravitate toward this book, read the back and place it back on the shelf.  I should have listened to my instinct.  After many positive recommendations from friends and reading the reviews, I relunctantly check the book out at the local library.  I started reading with an open mind.  After about 200 pages, I phone my friend to ask her if I was missing something, because I just didn't care of the story and I couldn't seem to find a connection with any of the characters.  At this point, she instructed me to stop reading - "because of you don't like it now, there isn't anything earth shattering that will happen that will make you change your mind."  I didn't listen, and she was right.

There is a reason this book is so popular. Not only is a swift-moving adventure, a historical fiction, but it's a a love story about life. And, Sarah Gruen is extremely adept at vividly describing the interior life -- not only of the circus and circus life she so carefully researched but also the interior, psychological experience of her characters, including Jacob, the lead character -- even as an old man. She enters into his experience so deeply that it is impossible as a reader, not to as well! You see the nursing home, the circus, the animals, the rough competition, and the connection.Sarah Gruen has created a book which transcends the circus, and highlights the importance of life and living, no matter how old we are.This is indeed summer reading, and one of the best books I've read all year.

I love this novel. I started reading a printed version, but I had a hard time distinguishing character voices as it was not always marked. And then there were alternating "young" and then "old" point of view chapters. Before giving up (because I have the same type of challenge when I read Amy Tan novels), I switched to the audio "book on tape" and LOVED the book. One of the best novels I've read. And the voice-over talent who read the audio version is a very, very good storyteller.

Do you know how difficult it is to run and cry at the same time? Good books do that do me. And this was a good book.Brilliant, actually.That's the best way to describe it. The words themselves, the characterization, the anticipation. It's brilliant.Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is the story of Jacob Jankowski at twenty-three and at ninety (or ninety-three). At twenty-three, he ran away and joined the circus after his parents were killed in an accident. He had been studying to be a vet and was all but final exams. In the circus, Jacob encounters brutality, unexpected kindness, and love. At ninety (or ninety-three), Jacob's in a nursing home.The story fits well with Resurrection with it's themes of dignity, redemption, and anticipation. Twenty-three-year-old Jacob's Resurrection scene spread the resurrection and transformation to others. The Jacob in the end of the book is different from the Jacob in the beginning, and his transformation allows him to step in and fight for others. He may not always succeed in the way he desires, but he hands resurrection to others. It's a story about coming home.It's a story about dignity. Gruen frames the story so that you are hit by the fact that this old man, left to drool over Jello his last few years, is the twenty-three-year-old Jacob in the circus. These stories aren't just stories. They're stories of people we've forgotten about. It made me remember sitting at tea with my grandmother listening to her stories. I wish I'd written them down.It's about the dignity of the outcasts. In Depression-era America, especially on a circus, midgets, drunks, and the bottom-of-the-barrell working class were the outcasts. They weren't "needed" in society. They were easily disposed of. Because of this, Jacob becomes a Christ-figure restoring the dignity of a midget and a drunk, fighting for the oppressed, both human and animal.Gruen's strongest point, I think, is her ability to build anticipation. One scene captures it: Grady has (bad) news for Jacob. In waiting for Grady to spill it, Jacob notices the two drops of grease leaking from Grady's hamburger. Brilliance in these little details. The reader (namely, me) wants to shake Grady by the shoulders and scream at him to tell already!It's also about what Gruen doesn't write, where she holds back. I think as writers, sometimes we think we have to fill in every detail. For example, in a fight scene, Gruen doesn't give a blow-by-blow. Rather, she focuses on the confusion of the protag (Jacob), his swirling thoughts, a moment of pain here or there, his inability to stop hitting. Rather than observing the fight as you would a movie, you're caught up in the hero. I love this.

I'm so glad that I did!  It really is the best thing that I've read in a long time.  I quickly became engrossed and could not put it down.

This book is one of the best books I've read in a long while.  It spoke to me on so many levels!  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it held me captive from cover to cover!  This Author really did her homework, and it shows in her details and imagery she paints for you.  If you say "I saw the movie, it wasn't all that"...well then, you need to forget everything you saw or heard on the silver screen, and pick up the novel!  Everyone knows Novels are ALWAYS better than the movie!  This one, especially.  When I read this book, I would laugh out loud and my Boyfriend (who is NOT a "reader") would say, "What's so funny" and I'd tell him a snippet about what I was reading....and before long, he and his 15 year old son were reading it right after me!I enjoyed it very much, and I believe you will too, or I wouldn't recommend it!Sincerely.Heather Lynn Osting - Author[...]

I. SettingDepression era. The glory days of the circus. A time when a plethora of men out-of-work combined with a plethora of families looking for amusement and a modicum of freaks. Let's face it: throughout history, mankind has been sprinkled with a modicum of physical and mental freaks. Their ability to find job satisfaction fluctuates, but they're always out there.(Caveat: As a child in Wisconsin, I certainly attended a circus or two, and dutifully watched the now-defunct Great Circus Parade on TV, but have never visited the Circus World Museum in Baraboo. I am just as much an outsider as the rest of you, unless you are a Flying Wallenda, in which case I am a much bigger outsider.)The circus of Water for Elephants is the (name of circus), which is certainly a mouthful. To the eyes of this non-Flying Wallenda, it appears to be pretty typical of the time, especially once it gets an elephant. More on that later.II. PlotJust a brief synopsis here, since you have likely seen the film, read the book, or are planning to do so. Jacob Jankowski (protagonist), runs away to join the circus after his parents die in a car accident. Perhaps unwisely, he does so just before finishing his veterinary degree. He meets August, the bipolar head trainer. He falls in love with Marlena, August wife. After the circus picks up an elephant named Rosie, Jacob uses his profound understanding of animals (and the Polish language) to bond with her. And with Marlena. Since August is a total jackhole, though, this relationship is doomed.Luckily for everybody, the circus owner (Big Al) is known for cutting corners, and his spendthrift ways end in total calamity. The animals get loose, August is trampled to death, and Jacob sweeps Marlena off to live happily ever after. They have children, he works for a real circus (Ringling), and end up ditching the nursing home for yet another circus.III. CharactersI couldn't help but picture Robert Pattinson in my head as I read this book, and I hated that. Same for Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz. Nothing to be done, but I wish it had been left to my imagination.Though I found the premise a little unbelievable on the whole (literally running away to join the circus?), I did empathize with Jacob. Preparing for a profession that requires you to stick your hand up a cow's butt is hard enough. Once your parents are tragically killed? Forget about it.The Jacob/Marlena/August love triangle didn't convince me either, but perhaps that was residual cringing from Jacob's sexual awakening facilitated by the ladies of the cooch tent.(I should also apologize to the man sitting next to me on the bus that one day. Sir, if you happened to notice that I was reading about a man getting deflowered, I DO APOLOGIZE.)Honestly, the character I liked best was old Jacob. (No, my favorite was not the elephant. I did not cheer when she killed August, nor at the many times the reader was reminded that ELEPHANTS ARE PEOPLE TOO. Save it for Greenpeace.) Old Jacob, an imperfect narrator, combined the indignities of old age with a fierce desire to keep living. He doesn't remember how old he is, nor which of his many relatives was supposed to take him to the circus camped next to the nursing home. But he's feisty enough to scoot himself over when no one else will, and it's that same sort of self-determination that won us two world wars, darnit!*wipes tear from eye*Maybe I'm just nostalgic for the grandpa I never had. It's like that scene from The Royal Tenebaums, when Royal reads the gravestone of a man who died heroically on a sinking ship. The viewer is led to believe this is a relative of Royal's. He then says something like, "What a man. I wish I knew him."Well, I wish I knew Jacob Jankowsky. After he finished all that silliness with the circus.IV. StyleGruen uses a framing device, in which the bulk of the book is recalled through the eyes of the now-aged main character. The parallel? Present-day Jacob is eagerly anticipating a trip to the circus, whereas past-day Jacob worked many years on a circus. I do love the framing device, confusing as it is when you start the book. (More or less than in medias res? Discuss.)I appreciate a single protagonist/point of view kept constant throughout the book. I would not have liked to read a chapter told by Marlena, or the elephant, or the dwarf. It's hard enough keeping these people (and animals) straight with just one narrator.The ending was a little tidy for my taste--I kept expecting Marlena to miscarry or die in childbirth. That their long and productive union disappointed me probably speaks more to my own predilection for dystopian fiction (where EVERYBODY dies) than Gruen's storytelling abilities.The pacing was good, and you definitely knew when the book climaxed. I appreciated the real-life archival circus photographs scattered throughout, as well as the small details of circus life: the cookhouse flag, the water buckets, the segregation of performers and labor. Who knew that 50,000 people were paralyzed after drinking Jamaica ginger extract? Not me, even after watching the entire first season of Boardwalk Empire. HBO fail.Conclusion:Water for Elephants is a "slice of life" novel. In this case, Depression-era circus life. My criticisms aside, it's a worthy read. While researching this blog entry (ie reading the Wikipedia article), I learned that this novel originated in NaNoWriMo. If given one month to write a book, I would certainly do much, much worse.

Water for Elephants draws you in from the very beginning. The story is fast paced and details circus life during the Depression years, making the reader see that for many, the circus was a way to keep food in one's stomach, when others had no jobs and were going hungry.Gruen does a good job of detailing the factual side of operating and working a circus, while keeping the story engaging. The only minor problem is that characterization is a bit weak, especially regarding Jacob, the main character.The book contains photos from circus archives, which is a nice touch.

I had no or low expectations about this book. I didn't know anything about the plot. It was on the bestseller lists, which doesn't necessarily make it a good book, but I was a little intrigued about all the peripheral hubbub about it. If I had known this book really had to do with circuses (That's not a plot spoiler.), I don't know if I would've started this book. I'm so glad I took the chance. I found it just like a steam engine (read the book); it took a little bit of effort to get rolling, but once it started it just kept picking up speed and going and going and I kept waiting for it to slow, but it didn't. I was amazed that someone actually wrote this story, it was so good. I read it fast and furiously and tensely anticipating what was coming next. I also really appreciated the "discussion" with the novelist after the novel itself. I enjoyed her explanations. Kudos to Sara Gruen.

Circus life, during the American Depression. Told in the first person by Jacob Jankowski a young college boy who is suddenly orphaned and penniless and finds himself literally on board the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth! There's a prologue where we discover a secret which Jacob has kept for seventy years then we begin the story, alternating between 1931 and the modern day with an elderly Jacob.Very easy to read...I found myself flicking pages quickly. Gruen seems to capture the circus's attraction and glitz as well as it's often uncomfortable reality. The hierarchy from the roustabouts to the performers and bosses is fascinating and Gruen's descriptions bring to life the days when circuses had trains (conjuring up images from Dumbo!)The novel pulls you in, starting off slowly and ends up unputdownable as you have to find out what eventually happened/happens. I found the contrast between the way the Jacob of 'then' and 'now' is treated, both startling and thought provoking and ultimately I just really enjoyed reading about something I had little knowledge of, with a good twist in the tale.

In this day and age, there are few books that I love - but Water for Elephants is one of the best books I have read this year. The story is told from an old man in a retirement home reflecting on his life as a circus veterinarian. Not only is the fictional story intriguing, the history of circus life in the 1930s is riveting in this book.

This book can be pretty graphic for younger kids.  I was a little surprised when I read it.  Our oldest was 12 when she finished it, her teacher had recommended it.

Too graphic for kids, too infantile for adults...this was just an OK book. I read it because several people recommended it for our book club at work. Many of the characters were so badly drawn and one-dimensional that I lost interest mid-story. The August character in particular was the worst creation: he's a ripoff of Nathan from William Styron's "Sophie's Choice." Marlena is just sequined cardboard. I enjoyed the setting because there's something fascinating about circuses, or else I would have rated this lower than 3 stars. For a book supposedly about people who care about animals, it doesn't have touching moments or much emotion. Vastly overrrated novel.

I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to "run away" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.

I wound up enjoying the book tremendously, more than I expected to when I started.The story starts out slowly, but subtly draws you in until you are intrigued as to what's going to happen next. The world of circuses, at least to me, was completely unknown - so I couldn't predict what was coming. I was surprised at what horrible conditions both the people and the animlas endured on "train circuses" of the 1920s-1940s. If you're looking for a happy "magical" story about running away to join the circus, this isn't it.The character development is limited, as it is written in the first person. My favorite character was Rosie the elephant - because the narrator clearly loves her and therefore you love her.Apparently Gruen did vast research on the train circuses - making her use of jargon, lore and the incorporating of actual stories the core of the novel.As far as I can remember, this is the first time I read a book that provides insight from the perspective of an old person living in a nursing home or assisted living facility. Jacob's frustration at his body failing him and of people making decisions for him and treating him like a child, along with feelings of being abandoned and useless really got to me and were gently and movingly written.The magic comes in the highly improbable, yet tremendously satisfying ending.I definitely recommend the book.

I enjoyed the parts with young Jacob, but didn't like the transition to nursing home Jacob. I would have given this book 5 stars if it weren't for those interludes, which just made me sad and empty. I believe the story stood just as strongly without the flashforwards. The relationship between Marlena and Jacob was titillating, and I was just as consumed with routing for them as I was waiting for August to get what he deserved. I haven't been so affected by a villain on the page in a long time--perhaps it was his abuse of the animals, especially Rosie, which made him so heinous in my eyes.Gruen's treatment of her secondary characters ranged from well-developed to shadows, but each served his or her own purpose because that's how I imagine life in a circus community--there are so many people around all the time that you would feel you know them, even if you hadn't actually held a real conversation with them.The circus rocked, but even the quasi-happy ending couldn't bring me out of the funk of the nursing home.

I couldn't put it down. I love, love, love this beautiful novel. You will never look at a circus or an elephant the same. Sara Gruen's illustration of memory is a very special thing. This novel gives life to spectacular people you come to love and hate, but moreso miss when you've turned the last page.

I can't say it was bad but it sure wasn't good. I have had the book for many years and just got around to reading it. Major disappointment considering the hype and accolades. It had the potential to be much better, but it was trite and lagged all the way through, for the most part. I'm mystified by the massive attention. It, in my opinion, is mediocre, at best. 3 stars is the max I can give it. Great literature it's not. Sophomoric comes to mind.

A ninety--or is it ninety-three?--year-old man recalls his days as a circus veternarian.  Murder, Romance, Intrigue and all the stuff of Trains, Depression and Prohibition give this novel sizzle.  Eleven and a half hours on ten CD's and worth every second of it.  Don't miss this one.

I admit it, I liked this book. It revolves around themes of "who is my family" when one is adrift at sea, biologically speaking. I know there are criticisms of the cruelty to animals issues and I was uncomfortable with them also. However, the story is set in the 1920-30's and it is about the circus. I believe Ms. Gruen wrote accurately about how animals fared in that time and place.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont

This engrossing book sucks you into its colorful world and holds you there until the 800-pound fat lady sings.Plot summary:Veterinary student Jacob joins the Benzini Bros. circus train in 1931 and falls in love with Marlena, an equestrian performer, who happens to be married to his boss the volatile animal director August.Pros:This is a must-read, page-turner featuring a unique setting for a classic love triangle. It's gripping and complex, with some wonderfully written supporting characters such as Walter, Camel, Uncle Al and Rosie the elephant. The tension slowly builds between the central characters, but is relieved with some laugh-out-loud moments from circus lore. The story is told in flashbacks from a 93 year old. There are some truly poignant moments at the nursing home. This is a really unique, well-done and entertaining book, and I liked that I couldn't guess the ending.Cons:Virtually non-existent and what there is is nitpicky, but here goes... It's written in present tense, which takes some getting used to. On p. 147: "A black boy offers to shine my shoes."  My 98-year-old grandmother uses the term "colored" and I believe that was the common term in the `30s and that "black" was a '60s term. Again, stupid nitpicky and doesn't detract from this fabulous book.Worth all of the hype, this is one of the best books I've read this year (and I've read a lot of books.) Read the book before you see the movie. Enthusiastically recommended. 5 stars.

-Juvenile and disney plot.-faulty and unrealistic details.-Uninteresting and underdeveloped characters.-Premature professions of love.Basically, this book reads like a typical Hollywood movie. This is unfortunate, but it is representative of a new class of novelists who are more influenced by movies' depiction of culture, rather than the actual culture itself. Minus all the R-rated stuff, this is nothing more than a whimsical book for adolescents. Once again an underwhelming and lazy manifestation of a great concept.

I&#8217;m ambivalent about this novel. It&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s very nice. It&#8217;s a page-turner. It doesn&#8217;t suffer the fate of many, many novels &#8212; even some of my best loved &#8212; but there was something missing.That&#8217;s a convoluted way of saying I enjoyed it but it didn&#8217;t stick with me.Plot and pacing are excellent in this novel. I often write that most books need to be shorter. Novelists seem to always come up with a great opening. Better ones have great endings. Most fail in the middle. That middle third of most novels is such a bore to me. I think it&#8217;s filler to beef up a word count. I didn&#8217;t find this in Water for Elephants at all. Gruen can structure a story and keep the pace going. That&#8217;s a terribly hard thing to do and she pulled it off wonderfully.With one glorious exception, however, the characterization fell flat for me. Did I care about the characters? Kinda. Did I care about the romance? No. What did touch me was the role of the older Jacob. How this young, female writer climbed into the head of a ninety plus year old man, I&#8217;ll never know but his thoughts and actions rang true. He was facing death but still facing life and his inner monologue caused an almost claustrophobic feeling in myself. My god, I kept thinking. This could very well be me - trapped in a body, aware that I&#8217;m losing my mind to age and, most frightening of all, without the ability to do a damned thing about it. I hope to elicit that kind of reaction in a reader one day.The parts of the novel confined to an old man doing nothing much more than sitting in a wheelchair will stick with me for a while. I may go back and read those bits at times. The parts with the trains, circus, performances, midgets, elephants, romance and violence? Not so much.

Excellent read! Ms. Gruen masters character and plot with beautiful prose. I remained captivated and found myself caring for the diverse cast.  Ms. Gruen successfully evokes a sense of the times, the desperate nature of survival during the Depression, as well as one's attempt to salvage one's sense of self as age betrays the body.  The storyline is suspenseful, true to period, and woven through with a touch of romance.  The setting is gritty and evokes the reality of Circus life on the road and  the behind-the-scenes work required to attain the magical world the public craves.  Well done!

Actually, come to think of it, my time would have been better spent staring at an hourglass.  This book was a soap opera in print.  The characters were mostly stereotypical, ergo predictable.  I don't think giving the ending away in the prologue was such a great idea, because I spent the next 330+ pages waiting for something (anything!) to happen in that vein.  Instead I found myself wading through pages of the author describing events such as tent raising, etc..  The romantic scenes were very campy.  During the first several chapters when the book's format became aparent, I thought it was very fascinating to have the elder scenes interspersed with the circus scenes.  It turns out that they didn't add much to the story, or even make me want to keep reading.  The writing in the elder scenes was amusing, and soon those chapters became my reward for reading the cirucs chapters.  The ending was perhaps the most aggravating aspect of this book.  Something about Gruen's description of circus life and all its attendant characters makes me think it highly unlikely that a modern-day cirucs manager would embrace a decrepit old man and rescue him from life at the rest home.  Maybe it was all those descriptions of redlighting we were given...I'm not sure.  All said, I enjoyed Gruen's writing style, but I would have enjoyed it much more telling a story with some substance.

So great I read it twice - and am reviewing both versions at once!Jacob is in the last weeks of veterinary school at Cornell when he is hit with a massive shock: the death of both of his beloved parents, and more importantly the loss of everything he owns to the bank.  This is the throws of the Depression.  He does what every man would do in his situation, hops a train to anywhere only to find out it is the circus train of The Benzini Bros. Greatest Show on Earth!  As the show's veterinarian he forms a close relationship with crazy August (the equestrian trainer), his wife Marlena (a performer), and Rosie (the elephant).  As the days go on, life on the circus gets crazier and crazier, until one day all hell breaks loose.  What will Jacob do next?This book is narrated by two voices - that of the 90 something year old Jacob (retelling the events as he remembers them) and that of the 20 something year old Jacob (experiencing the events).  The audiobook did an amazing job of casting two narrators and it made it one of the best books I have listened too.  You were easily able to tell at what time you were by who was narrating and it made it feel so real.Gruen does an amazing job of researching the life of circus workers during the Depression.  At no time did I feel that the details were out of place.  You could feel the desperation of the roustabouts when they were continually not paid, resorted to drinking bootleg liquor, ran out of food.  Reading this book was like stepping back in time.I loved this book!  It is easily very near the top of my favorite books list.  According to the authors website, Fox 2000 has purchased the rights to this book to make a movie and hear rumor that Reese Witherspoon might be cast as Marlena.  I think it would make a fantastic movie.

As you can tell from the near 5 star consensus from reviewers, this is a wonderful book, so I don't really need to go into a long drawn out review, but I will say that I loved the rich, interesting characters who felt like old friends by the end of the book and the story was engrossing and lovely - a true love story between lovers, between friends and between man and beast. And the total immersion into another world and time was just a bonus. You can't go wrong with this book!

Water for Elephants is a story about an old man's recollection of his days working for the circus, and the bizzare array of characters circus work attacts.  The setting transitions between the wild memories of working as a veterinarian for a travelling circus, set in the 1930s, and the protagonist's present life in a home for the elderly, lonely and unappreciated.  Themes of the book include romance, good vs evil, depression era desperation, and life in old age.The main character is a well studied near-graduate from an Ivy league school who loses everything after a catastrophe and feels he must run away and happens upon a circus train. He ends up working in very rough conditions to survive, and struggles with a love triangle that puts his life in peril.My personal affection for the book lies in the brutal conditions desperate people will endure, particularly for those who feel they have no place to go, as some of these characters do.  I'm also very fond of the contrast of how the elderly protagonist struggles with trivial tasks, like wanting to eat a crisp apple, while his younger self survived through such turbulent times.  Finally, the layout of the story, in which some details are revealed out of order through the time-transitions, enables the reader to piece certain details together before the main narrative gets to it feels like a device out of the movie Pulp Fiction (in a good way).This novel is written based off of actual and anecdotal incidents of circus life (as per the interview with the author contained in the back of the book).  The historical basis, however, is unnecessary to appreciate the vivid story but definitely made me appreciate the author's research to include tidbits of American history that might otherwise be lost.  I found this novel to be the most compelling book I have ever read and literally lost hours of sleep over it.

Characters were constantly doing things that just didn't make any sense.  His parents are both killed in a tragic accident a week before his finals, and his professors do NOTHING to give him the benefit of the doubt on his exams?  Were incompletes a complete unknown in this time period?  (There's a lot more, but I'm trying to block it out....)  The main character himself seems to have virtually no inner life except a vague desire to get laid.  At one point he says he's interested in animals, but there sure no evidence of this.The entire first half of the book is exposition about circus life, with a long segment of gratuitous titillation thrown in.  I've got nothing against &#34;gritty&#34; and &#34;true to life&#34;.  However, I have no tolerance for scenes that are so obviously there only to sell the book as soft porn to an audience that wouldn't know literature if it hit them in the face.Characters are less 3-D than cardboard cut outs.  My dad's vague recollections of a circus coming to town when he was a kid in this time period were way more riveting.  At least they involved actual people, with real human motivations -- not characters who move from point A to B only because the author's outline said the plot had to move there.And present tense?  Throughout the entire book?  That's a device that should have been discarded in high school.  It does nothing but make me snicker at the author's obvious lack of writing talent.I had heard a rumor that this book was written as a NaNoWriMo project, and I can certainly believe it.  It seems to have been dashed off from a previously constructed outline, without any regard for building up characters and then modifying the plot if it made more sense for their motivations.  The present tense writing style is another give away that this was written in a rush and barely revised.  And the plonking in of vocabulary and &#34;facts&#34; willy-nilly -- stopping what little story there is in mid-stream -- kind of screams &#34;first draft&#34; all the way through.

I got this on the Kindle when it went on sale. I'm so glad I did. What a wonderfully researched book. The details are amazing and the story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. I had never heard of this book until the movie came out, which looks a bit "chick-flick'ish" to me but the book definitely is not. I have not seen the movie yet (waiting for the DVD) but I am anxious to see if its true to the book.I think people of all genres will like this book. I normally read paranomal fiction but I really loved this book. My mom usually reads non-fiction girly books and she loved it. I even have my husband reading it now. So by all means, get this book!

I love historical novels, and this is one of my favorites. The circus in the Great Depression era is a great setting for the underlying love story. The internal struggles the main characters go through are timeless, and highly resonate with our modern times, perhaps in part because both eras had economic hardship. The book is narrated by a 93 (or 96, as he can't remember his real age) man. His character is very well put together, very real. The book has an optimistic message of triumph over adversity and the value of friendship and true love.

I loved this book. A tender love story recounted by a nonagenarian in present time.USA, 1930s. Jacob Jankowski had it all planned out: about to become a veterinarian, looking forward to join his father's practice, fate disrupts everything. Almost overnight, he is employed in a circus, the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Animals love him and he loves animals, but not only. He falls in love for the very first time in his life. But love, just like wild animals, can be dangerous if one is not too careful, and it slowly dawns on him that all the glittery world of a circus is not always what it seems...The book is written in alternating chapters between present day and the past. The present day is represented touchingly, moving in a few parts, although the main character Jacob, now mostly sitting on a wheelchair with a few aches and pains, still has a sense of humour and a passion for life that is uplifting. He is now ninety. Or ninety-three.The chapters about his past are absorbing and mesmerizing not only because of him falling in love for the first time with lovely Marlene, they also offer an engaging insight of circus life, the workers, the animals, and what is behind all those lights and delights. Very interesting.So drum roll please. Let the show begin Ladies and Gentlemen. Sit back and be prepared for a few surprises, enjoy the show!

I have to say that this book, was very much like a soap-opera. Everything was pretty predictable, and that ruined it. I have no clue why she choose this title, especially since Rosie doesn't play that much of a dominate role, (as was expected). What held this book together was the old Jacob, and just the curiousity, to make sure what you predicted was correct. Overall, I say if your looking for a fast read, enjoy.

While this book required significant research about the circus, I relished the insightful development of the old man in a nursing home.  It caused me to reflect on aspects of elder care that we don't know or rarely consider.  I read a novel occasionally between my favorite genre of the moment in non-fiction.  This fit the bill.  I couldn't wait to return to it when my reading was interrupted.  A lovely story and welcomed page turner.

Water For Elephants is an excellent novel depicting railroad circus life during the early part of the 20th century.  The author, Sara Gauen researched boxcar circuses before writing Water, the societal environment of the depression, attitudes toward circus workers by owners, treatment of the animals in the menageries and how they were obtained during the depression era then rapped everything into the lives of her main characters, add to this the breaking of the sexual mores frowned on by society, mix, and you have a recipe that makes for good reading.  The best thing about Water is the telling of the story by Jacob Jankowski, who is a 90 or 93 year old Vet depending on how you look at it, now confined in a residential nursing home and looking back into his past. Heads up folks Water for Elephants is coming out as a movie soon and I am looking forward to seeing it.

I read this book a while back and I must agree with every 1,2 stars reviewer out there it is Overrated, plain and simple. I know a lot of people are interested in reading this book because of the recent Major Motion Picture starring Rob Pat and Reese Witherspoon.Oh, Well the premise of the story is quite interesting, an almost college graduate who runs away after his parents tragic death (nope this is not a spoiler it's in the back cover) only to join a traveling circus where he goes from a stable boy to the circus vet in a course of (well less than a year), and falls in love with a married showgirl named Marlena who is suffering under her abusive husband August (who is described as being schizophrenia but every psychologist will tell you he's just an aggressive, controlling jerk with anger management problems).So, this book has all the elements possible to make it a good read, Adventure, Romance, Drama, and forbidden love Blah Blah Blah !Adventure, Hardly ! Action (Well apart from the few scenes of hopping in and out of trains there's hardly any to count), Romance & Forbidden love ? (the romance element although seems to sum up a big part of the story even bigger than the circus is so contrived, lacking and unrealistic. The characters hardly hold a conversation to make us believe they belong together, I didn't care if Marlena and Jacob separated for life ! Actually I found myself hoping they would just to spice up the book from its predictable ultimate boring ending and I'm a person who loves happy endings) Circus Life ? Well, Yeah its there all right but the writing doesn't allow it to come to life. I never felt transported to the 193os, I never felt that I was in a circus. The descriptions were unfortunately very flat.The characters are the biggest disappointment in the book. They are two-dimensional at best as well as stereotypical. The Good guys are innocent, nice and bearing all the sufferings of the world on their shoulders and the bad guys are greedy jerks and a$$holes who only care about profit and the $$$ money !Some people were complaining about the Over the top sex scenes, Ahh, O.K ! I'm used to reading romance books heavy on sex scenes and this one doesn't even come close. I don't mind sex in books as long as there is a reason to it and as long as it is beautifully written. In here the characters are just flat out boring that they make sex and murder boring.Obviously none of them is sympathetic even Jacob who just lost his parents, we never get insight into his soul. We never knew for sure why or how was he driven by depression and shock after his parents death to leave all his life behind him and join a circus, we never even know how he recovered from the lost of his parents because he never show any signs of being sad or depressed. Marlena on the other hand, well she is in an abusive relationship so its O.K that she cheats on her husband with Jacob. It would've been rather interesting if her husband was actually a good man but she fell out of love with him and ran away with Jacob leaving the circus. Now that would've been a better conclusion !This book/author does the fatal mistake of telling instead of showing. We are told that this and that happens but we are never shown and therefore never transported. I give it 2 stars for entertainment value and because it was a fairly easy/fast paced book to read. However, other than that maybe I was expecting too much but this book is overhyped and frankly way overrated.

***SPOILER ALERT***Put this novel on the FUN READ shelf. Definitely nothing mind-blowing in terms of plot or prose but a very entertaining look at depression era circus life.The author alternates (for the most part) chapters between Jacob's life during the depression and his life as a 90 year old in a nursing home. One gets the sense that the author seeks to evoke some sympathy for the 90 year Jacob's plight. In this endeavor she fails as she never fully fleshes out his relationship with his children. Thus the reader is left feeling slightly apathetic as to his plight as a lonely and ornery old man wasting away in a assisted living facility.Finally, the ending is a bit contrived and convenient. The frail old Jacob making a break for it out of the retirement home and going to the circus event that is in town. There of course he meets and befriends one of the circus directors who spirits him away on their cross country tour. Happily ever blah blah blah.All of this is not to discourage someone from reading this novel. The author can write with rhythm and keeps the pacing light and quick. Viewing the novel as a love story, the author is adept at capturing the dual emotional nature of love with phrases like: "exhausted and recharged, desperate and fulfilled." With a good writer, this book would make a great movie.

Water for Elephants was a fantastic book.  Easy to read and interesting.  Most impressively, a topic that I never gave much thought to, Depression-Era travelling train circuses, was something I enjoyed reading about.  To be honest, I never knew there was such a topic.  Now I'm wondering if there are any Industrial Revolution cat juggling books out there that I should be reading.  Anyway, Gruen seemed to do a decent amount or research for the book, so I learned a little something about the topic.  The best part of the book was the fantastic ending.  More books should end like that.

This is one of those books that I read because I loved the movie first. So, I was quite surprised when I read how the book begins - with the murder of one of the main characters. When I further realized that August does not own the Benzini Brothers, I began to see the movie as its own story separate from the book.Jacob is by far the most interesting character of the book, especially since he tells the story as an old man in a nursing home - and has the wisdom and experience to go with his age. His emotions are infectious and I longed to sit down with him and listen to all of his stories in person way before I finished the book.August is the kind of villain that is confusing in his evil deeds - he has schizophrenia - which makes it somewhat unfair to dislike him so much. His irrational behavior has been exploited for the almighty dollar by Uncle Al - but the real villain tends to fade into the background.Marlena is beautiful to the point of angelic, very little of what she does can be considered wrong in any way, as she is a victim struggling for freedom for most of the book. She approaches August's mood swings with the same caution due a wild animal, and remains faithful to him despite her personal feelings, and does not leave until he first betrays her. Considering how women today will leave their husbands for any reason, I admire her strong morals.The background is set during the Great Depression, which made for many intense situations as the circus struggled to profit, as well as the survival of the cast of characters. Though I studied this period in American history, the direct experience gave me a clearer idea of the desperation of people alive during this time - how easily morals could be put on hold for the sake of another mouthful of food or another coin in the pocket. So many men of the circus would work without pay for the promise of another meal and unending hope that life could still improve.Rosie, the elephant, is also one of the most fascinating characters in the book. She proved to be only one example of how animals were exploited to the point of cruelty for profit. I could not help wondering where the animal activists were.Needless to say, this book sparked many conversations and inspired many moments of personal contemplation for me. I loved this book, and I highly recommend it.

I read Water For Elephants for the second time on Kindle and it was just as exciting as the first time I read it. The book is like being right there at a Barnum and Bailey circus with popcorn and peanuts.  The character, Marlena, was so real, accepting her role as the abused woman and then finally escaping the tyrant she had married.  All of the characters seemed to come to life there on the page.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the scenes. And in the end, when the animals were stampeding, it was interesting to learn that the circus band struck up a particular march to alert the circus performers to take cover or escape.  An excellent read.

Jacob Jankowski, the main character, is a 90 or 93 year old man in a nursing home and he tells the story of how he wound up joining a circus in his early 20's.  His parents are both killed in a car accident and finds out that his parents have mortaged everything to pay for his tuition at Cornell Vet school.  Figuring that he is unable to continue his education and he jumps on a train in the middle of the night running away from everything he had known.  The train that he winds up on is a circus train.He befriends several individuals and winds up working for the outfit.  One particular person is a married woman named Marlena.  Jacob's boss is Marlena's husband, August.  August is a bit off mentally to say the least.One of the most remarkable and memorable characters in the book is an elephant that the circus aquired named Rosie.  When she is first aquired August believes she is dumbest animal on earth because she would not do anything that they tried to get her to do.  Because of this August beats Rosie on a regulart basis until Jacob by accident discovers that she only understands commands given to her in Polish.  After that discovery Rosie is the star of the show alongside of Marlena.Things don't stay rosy for long.  August has more fits, ex circus employee's who were thrown off the train catch up, and performers get sick and tired of what has been happening.  It all comes together in a pretty horrific, yet kind of an amusing scene in the end.Not only did I enjoy the story of Jacob's circus days, but I also enjoyed Jacob's narration about getting old.  It really makes you think about how we treat the elderly and how we should be treating them.

Sara Gruen spins a fascinating tale of murder, love, obsession, and life in Water for Elephants.  The characters were interesting and well developed.  Her portrayal of the elderly was spot-on without being stereotypical.  That's a very difficult thing to do; not many authors are capable of unraveling the story of an elderly character.Her portrayal of circus life is intriguing, and the characters never failed to invoke strong feelings of endearment, horror, amusement, or pity.  I wouldn't call this a "must read," but it is definitely an interesting story that was well written and well researched.

I had heard this was a good book.  I was misinformed.  This was the most crude, foul book I have ever attempted to read.  Though the main story was mildly interesting, the all too frequent use of profanity and descriptions of intimate relations put me off entirely.  I started trying to use white out to cover the offensive items.  I quickly realized that would include a great deal of the book.  I decided I didn't want to fill my mind with such things and stopped reading.  This book went directly into the recycle bin rather than being donated to a thrift store.  I didn't want another unwitting person to go through the same experience I did.

This book was slow to start but once I got into it I could not put it down.  It twisted and turned all over the place.  It was such a relief despite some of the more depressing points that it had a great happy ending.  The author did a great job giving Rosie the elephant human characteristics.  I liked that it was told from the point of view of an older man looking back.  Even his ending to the story was an amazing one.  I would definantly recommend this book to a friend.

If you're an middle-aged old fart like me, this book might be too much for you. It was nearly overwhelming for me, and it invaded my dreams over the few nights in which I read it. Nonetheless, it's an excellent read. A rending read. A compelling read. Moreover, you might think the author knows you, and is telling a version of your life's story if you, like me, are a middle-aged old fart.

When a book is a best seller and has gotten the reviews this book had I expected something better.  In the end, I felt like the book was average.  I am 26, and am generally not interested in reading books about depression era circuses and love triangles but I thought since this book got great reviews I would give it a shot.  After all, the best book I read last year was the Devil in the White City and I figured if someone could make the 1893 world's fair interesting perhaps 1930s circuses would be interesting as well.  Even with an open mind I couldn't get into the book.  40 or so pages about a 90 year old man - the remaining 300 he recalls his 3.5 months of his life in a circus when he was 22. first 100 pages were decent but then nothing real interesting after that.  Bottom line, if you don't like circuses or reading books about love triangles - don't make the same misstake that I did and buy this book because it is a best seller with great reviews.  If thats what you enjoy, then yeah, you'll probably like it.

It's also the only circus novel I've ever read. This is an entertaining drama novel with a love triangle. The characters are nicely fleshed out, and there is a nice to and fro between Jacob's current life as a ninety year old and his adventures in the circus. Gruen does a charming job of describing Jacob as an old man and the ending is very good. Whilst the book is good I think it has been lucky that it has benefitted from great marketing and a big budget film as there are other books which are more powerful & more deserving than this book that have not received any recognition.Enjoyably recommended.

When Jacob Jankowski's life is turned upside down, he inadvertently leaps onto a circus train and begins a seven year adventure as veterinarian to the circus animals. This is the predictable story of a boy who falls in love with the unattainable woman, compassion, cruelty, and the consequences meted out by an elephant.I enjoyed this book, but did find it rather predictable, and the ending was both bizarre and a major let down

Water For Elephants, written by Sara Gruen, is a book told as a memoir by a fictional ninety-something old man about his time with the circus as a young man. This experience matured him and forever changed the direction of his life.This book is charming. I could relate to the characters and understand their motivations easily. I enjoyed reading it and have re-read it several times. I highly recommend it to everyone. (Should be at parents discretion as there are some adult themes. Probably best for those over thirteen.)

When this book is telling the story of the circus, it is fascinating, describing a world that most readers know nothing about. But, possibly in an attempt to make it more "commercial", the author has chosen to focus on the love story, which is predictable. In those scenes, fascination turns to boredom.Use all that research (described in detail at the end of the book), Ms Gruen, to tell us more stories of the roustabouts, performers, animals and freaks of the circus - and forget the "plot" and the soap!

I found this book interesting because of the research Ms. Gruen obviously did on train circuses and depression-era life. I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book. Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here. The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider. We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains. Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and "Uncle Al", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page. For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish. I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well. Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater. He's simply too many things rolled into one. Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable. And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic. Perhaps if she'd actually used the "show, don't tell" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional. As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man. One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do. Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook. It's hard to respect a character like that. Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram. In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action. I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story. Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book 4 stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man. I also really got a kick out of the ending. But on the whole, I would recommend this as a library book or a used book store book -- definitely NOT one you pay full price for.

This is a wonderful book made better by excellent readers.Jacob Jankowski joins the circus as a young man after the death of his parents.  This was during the depression when many were willing to work for little more than regular meals.  Sara Gruen tells the story of a traveling circus with a surety that makes it hard to believe she has never experienced the cruelty, hard times and camaraderie of circus life.  Even more amazing, the story is told from the perspective of Jacob as a 93 year old man forgotten in a nursing home.There are two readers, one for the young Jacob and one for the old, and both are a true pleasure to listen to.

Yes it has its dark moments.  And yes it can be disturbing.  And that means the author did the job right.The book follows the life that was not an easy one and is not the perfect sunset of old age and conveys it all in the context of a world that most people do not know the in and outs about, the circus, but at the same time which is something we all have dreamed about.  If not dreamed about, at least were enamored with when we were young.As others said, I could not put this book down and lost a bit of sleep turning a few extra pages further in the evening.  But it was worth it.

I was visiting a local independent bookstore and asked the person in charge of romance novels for suggestions.  She named several books for me including Water for Elephants, which she insisted was great.  I was hesitant because it was not shelved in the romance section, but I tried it.  I figured romance readers must like this nonromance book, for her to suggest it.  Fiction lovers might rate this 4 or 5 stars, but since it is not my preferred genre, I gave it 3 stars which simply means "I liked it."  It was an interesting piece of fiction.  There were a variety of interesting and different types of characters including bad guys, good guys and friendships.  I enjoyed it, and I learned what circus life was like in 1931 including interactions with the animals.  I assume the author was reasonably historically accurate regarding circus life at that time.The story is told from Jacob's perspective when he was in his early 20s and in his early 90s.  Shortly before he was to graduate from Cornell veterinary school, his parents died, and the bank took all their property.  Jacob was too upset to sit for his final exams.  He left school and got a job with the Benzini Brothers circus, acting as vet for the animals.  He spent 3  months with that circus.  The elephant Rosie had a wonderful role.  Jacob developed a relationship with Marlena who was married to August the animal trainer.  August was physically abusive to animals, Marlena and others.Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: two.  Setting: 1931 and around 2001 circus traveling within the U.S.  Copyright: 2006.  Genre: circus, human relationships fiction.

I loved reading this as I had been taken to a circus a lot as a little girl in NE Illinois and as an adult I worked in 8 different nursing homes. It was wonderful seeing it from the patient's eyes and reading his story. I remember many a story told by patients. One was an old silent movie star! I wonder if Sara Gruen had any nursing home experiance as she nailed it including the caring and non caring type of people that work there and why some of the patients may be grumpy. The view of the circus behind the scenes was a fantastic story!

In  dismal times .  the  era 1930---the story unfolds with interest,and  meaning  and deep reflection of the main character who is now in a nursing home telling this story.A unique plot" The circus" , sure leads to imagination and wonder of the  people and circumstances of that era and  their  transient life  styles .  You can taste the vulnerablity of the main character. You can feel his love and applaud his decency.the author does a great job of depicting his image and feeding him throughout the book. I began to see the dirt under his nails and visioned his unkept state, yet, I liked him . the protagonst was well depicted-the author had me on the edge of my seat.  And Rosie, was described so well I felt her breath on my face and the breeze of her ears flapping.After 350 pages with  no frills - -the entire book takes place on a circus train and  the empty lots where the  circus acts  takes place--it behooved me that the book remained a real page turner . It was well written and held my interest. I recommend it to all audiences.

Well written, well researched and interesting look into a subject I knew little about. Although the book was about circus trains during the depression years, the real message was that getting old is "hell." What a heart wrenching portrayal of this man recalling his few years when he ran away and joined the circus. But mostly how horrible it is to be old, forgetting important things and having family forget you. Rosie the Elephant is a wonderful character.

This is a beautifully constructed book. The circus atmosphere is rich and detailed, and it's redolent of its time period. The images are strong and the pace, while not fast, is stately -- perhaps the way an elephant moves??I deducted a star for two reasons. First, it seemed that some leaps in the story came too quickly. Jacob should have spent a bit more time with Rosie before he made the statement "I was close to falling in love with her;" that happened a bit too fast to be believable. Also, the ENDING was awful: contrived and saccharine. That was a huge disappointment, after the rest of the book.Overall, though, a literary and very good read, two things that don't always go together.

I think that most people seem to either love this novel or hate it, but I have a hard time stirring myself to care much either way.  It is by no means a standout book, but neither is it so horrible that I couldn't force myself through it.The best writing in the book, I think, are the sequences with Jacob as an old man.  They ring true, and have a poignancy regarding the lives and treatment of the elderly that stirs some guilty discomfort.  Leaving aside the over-the-top, sappy, happy Hollywood ending, these sequences are satisfying and believable.The larger narrative, that of Jacob in his twenties, also has an air of authenticity, at least in terms of feeling (to an outsider) like a dingy, dangerous, depression-era circus.  It is successful at creating a strong sense of the world.  But I never found myself getting wrapped up in the stories of any of the individual characters.  In other words, I just didn't get pulled in.Some people probably take offense at the blatant sexuality of a handful of scenes, and at the mistreatment of animals in several more.  I am not personally bothered by these, as they are pertinent to the story, but neither do they stir me to care much about the outcome of the story.  In the end, it was an easy read with a vivid world, but lacking (for me) much character-driven interest.  So I'm on the fence about whether I like it or not.  But who says I have to pick a side?

I first heard about Water for Elephants as a project that began during NaNoWrimo a few years back when I was trying NaNoWrimo for the first time. It was inspiring to hear.Yet it took me years to get around to reading this book despite many recommendations.I LOVED it!The author did a lovely job of handling so many characters big and small. She kept solid control over their little quirks, tics, etc.I particularly enjoyed seeing everything first-person present through Jacob's eyes, but I do think he was more of a woman's man than a man's man. Not that I need him to be a boar or a brute, but he was a touch more on the emotional swing side than I generally like in male characters in stories of this ilk.Didn't really matter though, because the whole package of this tale enchanted me.Wholeheartedly recommend (but be prepared to be disappointed with the movie if you read the book first).

Water for Elephants"A Novel, Written By Sara GruenBook Review by Jay GilbertsonWho, in their right mind, doesn't like the circus? If you answered "yes," then this book is for you. If you answered "no" then this book is for you too. There is something for everyone in this tremendously well-researched novel of schizophrenic madmen, a possible murderer in pink sequins and a towering heroine who happens to be addicted to lemonade. What could be more fun?A depression-era circus can be the best place to be if you're Jacob Jankowski and you just buried your parents, found out they mortgaged everything they owned to send you off to veterinary college and ultimately you had nothing left to lose.Some of the central themes of this page-turner are to follow your instincts, stay true to what you believe in and try to survive no matter what. It's the what part that kept me flying through the book. The story shifts back and forth from Jacob at ninety (or ninety-three--he's not sure) to his incredible life on the train with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth--the circus! By incredible, I mean that there is a constant fear-factor woven underneath every nuance, every situation is rubbed raw in not ever being entirely sure of just what the future holds, or even if Jacob has one. That dread is dolled out in buckets-full by the head honcho of Benzini Brothers--Uncle Al--who can have you "red-lighted" (tossed off the train) for any number of indiscretions, or simply to lesson the load. The incredible part is that, in the end, Jacob not only manages to become the circus veterinarian, he also gets the girl, a bereaved dog, one elephant (Rosie) and eleven horses. Who could ask for more, you ask? Jacob Jankowski, that's who.Then there are the animals. A team of "Liberty" horses, lions and zebras and llamas, giraffes, chimps, panthers, and Rosie--the elephant--the Polish elephant no less. The elephant that, like all elephants, drinks far more water than anyone could ever imagine carrying, which is one of many parables in this fast-paced tale.Did I mention the train? Benzini Brothers traveled exclusively by steam-train. The train becomes a powerful force that literally grabs up entire, failing circuses in its path and absorbs them like the little fish being eaten by the bigger one.Think shark.Uncle Al is a "take no prisoners" kind of fellow, unless he can get you for a song. Then he owns your soul.The secondary story line, that of old Jacob looking back on his days with the circus, added a depth to this novel rarely seen in most modern literature. He may not know his exact age, but there is a spark of life in him not quite ready to waste away in the nursing home that has become his prison. Then a circus comes to town and begins to set up shop right next door to the nursing home. It's an opportunity that Jacob simply can't resist.You won't believe what happens next...

Yes, I know the ending seemed a little farfetched, but I LOVED it...and the rest of the book too. Being ignorant about the behind the scenes drama and actions of a circus, Sara Gruen educated me with her well-researched Water for Elephants. The novel was informative and well, graphic at times, and I'll never again enter the big top without feeling some compassion for the roustabouts, the performers, and the animals...especially the elephants. Ah, Rosie. Silver Star too.In addition to educating her readers about the traveling circus life of a bygone era, Gruen also tells a vivid and believable tale about a vet student who, because of a "cruel twist of fate," runs away to join the circus. Although the primary story revolves around Jacob and Marlena, the author does a fabulous job of character development as she describes Camel, August, Uncle Al, and other assorted circus folks in a story of love, cruelty, sadness, grief, and triumph.About that ending, I still think it's awesome and quite believable, especially for someone like Jacob who lived his life to the fullest. Maybe there's a lesson in that for all of us.

I was really eager to read this book after seeing all the great reviews for it.  However,  I started reading it and could not get into it.  The whole first half dragged for me, with not too much going on in the story. The writing was difficult to read at times, and I agree with some of the reviewers here, it often read as a screenplay which made it that much harder to get into.  But about halfway through the book, the plot starts moving and I actually end up finishing the book and I'm glad I did.  I'm still not sure why the book itself is getting rave reviews, but I am looking forward to seeing how the movie version of the book will turn out.

When his parents are killed in a car accident, 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski, in a state of shock, skips out on his veterinary school finals and hops a passing train. The train happens to be that of the Flying Squadron of the Benzi Brothers Greatest Show On Earth, a middle-of-the-road depression era circus. Jacob earns a job as the circus' vet, caring for a small menagerie of animals.The story is told by a 90- or 93-year-old (he can't remember which) Jacob living in a nursing home many years later. And although this aspect adds depth to Jacob's character, it dragged a little for me. However, the main story, that of Jacob's adventure with the circus, is full of energy. Parts of his romantic involvement with one of the circus performers felt a little predictable, but most of the story was engrossing. Gruen's meticulous research shows throughout the book. The story is never bogged down in details, but her vibrant writing brings the circus to life so well that at times I felt like I was watching a really good movie.

After reading the reviews of this book I knew I would not be disappointed. This is the first book I have read from this author and I found myself interested in the book from the first sentence.The main character (Jacob Jankowski) starts the story as a 90 (or is that 93?) year old man in a nursing home living out his life. He is unhappy and realizes that his kids and the world have forgotten him. He then thinks back to his early adult life when he was in school to become a veterinarian. He takes us back to those years of the Great Depression and the adventures he had while working for a small traveling circus.The book never lets you down and the characters that Jacob Jankowski meets will keep you interested. It is a book that, in my opinion, lays open the human experience. At times, the book takes a romantic and even very sensual tone. At other times, the cruelty of the Great Depression and the desperation of people who worked hoping for some type of income or food will remind you of the harsh life of those times.The book spends some time going back and forth from present day to the days when Jacob Jankowski was part of the circus. The ending surprised me and when I finished the book I was glad that I had the pleasure of reading such a great piece of fiction.

This novel is about love, murder and friendship and it's all centered around life in the traveling circus of the 1930s.  Not only does the author give history of a circus in the 30s, but she gives a very entertaining novel with very lovable characters.  She starts the novel out with the main character as an old man and then he tells the story of his days with the circus.  The old man is incredibly lovable.  The book only gets better with every page.

An interesting premise, Water for Elephants: a melodrama that takes place in a traveling circus during the first half of the last century. Throw in forbidden love, an abusive husband, murder, and a few other plot twists, and you're assured a best-seller followed by a Hollywood movie with a topnotch cast.I went to the circus as a boy; I never wanted to run away with it, but I enjoyed it; then again, I never feared clowns.I've had Water for Elephants on my reading list for more than a year; it was highly recommended to me but it just kept getting pushed down on my reading list. Finally, with the movie due out, I opted to make reading it a priority.I won't say I didn't enjoy it, but I can't say either that it's deserving of all the accolades it's received. Author Sara Gruen obviously had a passion for the circus, as evidenced by the research that went into this piece and the period.Normally I enjoy melodramas--Victor Hugo's Laughing Man comes to mind. But Elephants, for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, just missed.Maybe it's just me. Some call Romeo and Juliet the greatest love story ever written. I happen to think it's the most overrated piece of literature ever penned. I mean, come on, Romeo falls instantly in love with Juliet the first time he ever lays eyes on her, and only after they part does he realize he forgot to ask her for her name. Can true love be founded on such a shallow premise? No, he's just reacting to hormones. It's young love, which is not really love at all, merely lust.At first I thought it was because Ms. Gruen wrote the piece from the perspective of a male protagonist, and like a lot of cross-gender writing, it somehow lacks a certain authenticity. But Jacob is a likeable enough young man, flawed; recently orphaned, he joins the circus to what we in the 21st century would say, "Find himself." He certainly is attracted to Marlena, initially, for all the reasons a 20-year-old young man would be: she looks great in her pink sequined riding costume.But it wears old after a while--we want to see a relationship grow between them. What the story reveals is that Marlena, married, suffers from Battered Woman Syndrome. Her husband is mentally unbalanced and jealous to the point of insanity. He accuses her of infidelity with Jacob even though nothing has happened--except in their own mercenary hearts.Well, we were ready to impeach Jimmy Carter for admitting he'd lusted after women in his heart. Even the bible teaches that if your thoughts are impure, if you're unfaithful in your mind, you're just as guilty as if you'd committed the act. But nothing has happened between these two innocents except a shared kiss. But because her husband is such a beast we accept that it is okay and feel sympathetic toward Marlena since she is committed to make it work with her unbalanced husband because her parents previously told her, when she wanted to come home after admitting to them the marriage had been a mistake, that she had to lie in the bed she'd made.Yet I found neither Jacob nor Marlena very sympathetic; neither character was very memorable, even if the writing was sharp, crisp and authentic to the period. My sympathies lay with Rosie, the poor elephant who suffered such abuse at the hands of Marlena's husband she, the elephant that is, eventually killed him.Now that I've had more than a week to think about Elephants, to capture what seems to be an elusive reason for my indifference to this book, it occurs to me that a lot of books these days are written in this fashion, they expect the reader to connect with the character in their own way.I understand what that means and I don't disagree with it--until it's taken to an extreme and I'm presented with cardboard characters, caricatures.I want to connect with characters, not become them. I want to see how others respond to adversity. I can always later compare what I would've done, how I would've thought, were I in those circumstances.I guess, in the end, that's what was missing for me in Elephants: I just couldn't connect with Jacob or Marlena.Or, maybe at my age I just don't get young love anymore.

This is really a heart warming story. I especially loved the elderly Jacob. Working in Long Term Care, I so could see some of my patients over the years in Jacob and perhaps even caught a glimpse of how patients over the years have seen me! The ending warmed the cockles of my heart and left me smiling for days (well all day b/c I just finished it last night, but I can't see not smiling everytime I think about it). Definitely give this book  a chance. I waited when it was recommended to me b/c the Circus didn't really appeal to me, but it really was interesting to read about Circus life in the Depression Era. Loved the surprise twist when the epilogue picks back up at the end of the book! Didn's see that coming, but I guess that's the point. LOVED THIS BOOK!

I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to finish this book, once purchasing, because of the comments from reviewers about animal cruelty.  I am very, very sensitive to that topic, so I was leery, and I imagine others out there may be as well.  However, my desire to read the best seller, and my husband's assurances (after listening to it), that he thought I would be ok, convinced me to listen to it.  For those of you that might have this same problem, I think you should go ahead.  I really enjoyed this story and it's worth listening to.  Yes, I could have done without some of the scenes, but it all turns out in the end, and the author doesn't get too terribly descriptive or excessive - so that you just can't listen to another second.  Also, these scenes are limited, and they are kind of an integral  part to the story.  I listened to the audio version and the narrators are excellent as well.  Very enjoyable story!

I finally got around to reading Water for Elephants, it's been on my Kindle forever. I was interested in seeing the movie, but didn't want to until I read the book.It was good, especially the end. At times I wanted to finish just to move on to my next book, but at the end of I was hooked on seeing what would happen next. For some reason, I didn't get what all the craze was about though. Probably because I read a lot of really excellent books this year, including another circus book that blew this one away.

Water For Elephants tells the story of one man's life with the circus as the backdrop to all of his experiences.Jacob is a student studying to become a veterinarian when his parents are killed in an accident and he is left with no family, no money  and he walks away from that life.  He ends up picking up some work with a traveling circus and his life takes a turn that he never anticipated.  He becomes a part of the circus family (as dysfunctional as can be..........but they put the fun in dysFUNctional!)Jacob recalls his life, while he is over 90 years old and relegated to a nursing home. A nurse mentions that the circus is in town and everyone will have the opportunity to attend a show. As he sits at a dinner table with several other elderly folks, one man looking to gain attention from the women makes the claim that he "..used to carry the water for the elephants."  Jacob calls him a liar, because Jacob knows the amount of water that an elephant consumes, and those vast quantities could not be carried by one man.  When a nurse asks if Jacob worked in a circus he does not answer her, and that is when his memories are brought to life.  As he waits for his outing, the days pass and he relives the last 70+ years of his life in his mind.  The stories that are told about how the circus works, the value that is placed on the money coming in, the care or lack there of, for the animals, the living conditions on the trains for the circus workers...........all these things and more come alive in Jacob's tale.While it seems that the story starts a bit hesitantly, soon the reader is caught up in the tale, what happens to the different people, the relationship between the "stars" and the workers, many aspects of a traveling circus are revealed, even in the treatment of the animals!This story is an interesting portrayal of life in a traveling circus, and the ending is an unexpected one that takes you unaware.This is Sara Gruen's first novel and she is nominated for two Quill writing awards.

When I read a book, I want to immerse myself in it.  I don't want jarring inconsistencies to remind me that it's fiction, and not particularly well written fiction at that.  The speech of Jacob, who supposedly is in the setting of 70 years ago, is disturbingly nonauthentic.  People at that time didn't use the same phrases we use now and putting them in, when you're picturing them in the dress and background of that time period is annoying and unnecessary.  This author needed a better editor.  It's not a 'best' book and the fact that the author is begging for votes makes you wonder about her integrity.

Water for Elephants is a great read. I had a hard time putting the book down. This book has great characters, great scenes, and a great plot. I was fascinated by the narration of Jacob as an elderly man remembering his early days on the circus. I couldn't help but feel for the elder Jacob who was lonely and felt like he was just a trinket on a shelf that someone comes once a week to dust off. But the younger Jacob, I found myself rooting for him all through the story.The author has done a great job at incorporating the stories of the circus in to a story that seems so real. I was left with a connectedness to the characters and their struggles, their joys, and their feelings for one another.If you ever have ever been to the circus, and ever wondered what it would be like to work in the circus during the 1920's and 1930's when all the big circuses were traveling the United States, then this is a book you will have to read. You will not be disappointed.

I had high expectations for this, but it was kind of a chore to finish.  It was too depressing!  Too much brutality to the circus animals AND the circus humans, drunkenness, filth, squalor -- plus the portrait of life in the nursing home was grim.  When the narrator finally gets his true love, the author rushes through it in a few sentences and then goes back to the grimness.  I give her two stars because she's obviously done a lot of research on circuses, and I thought the photos were charming.

I have to admit that I wasn't initially excited to read this book. I kept hearing great things about it, but I just had no interest in reading about a circus. Then I saw the movie preview... and knew I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie (I'm rarely able to finish a book if I see the movie first). So I started reading, and had a hard time getting into it at first... I think this was mainly because I felt like I HAD to read the book... as if I was back in school! I eventually got past this and was able to get immersed into Water for Elephants.Usually, I rate books by how I feel while reading them, so my ratings are normally always subjective. In this case, I felt I had to give this book 5 stars based on the fantastic writing and the amazingly rich and unique backdrop of the train circus! It is obvious that the author did her research on circus culture and depression-era American history. She really dug into the down and dirty details of circus life. In the discussion after the last chapter you learn that many things in the story are based on true stories or anecdotes of the circus. The Bezini Brothers train circus is easily like another character in the book, flawed and deeply layered, like the characters themselves. I really liked how the story is told from Jacob's perspective as a spunky 93 year old man, having flashbacks of his life 70 year earlier. The altering perspectives (from young to old) effectively grounded the story and added another layer to his character.At times, this wasn't easy to read... It was sad to read about the indignities of being old, and I felt like Gruen's depiction was honest and very real. Though most of all, I had a really hard time reading some of the scenes with the animals. At one point I caught myself reading between my fingers, as if I was trying to block the scene from view as if it was a movie. I tried skipping over one but I had to go back and read it because I felt like it was important to the development of the characters and the story. It was, and they were. I just wish those scenes hadn't been seemingly timed to when I was getting ready to go to sleep.Seriously, I'm so glad I finally picked up this book. I highly recommend it!

I was very pleased with this book. Not the harlequin romance I was expecting, but turned out to be even more. You can't help but fall in love with the relationships Jacob has with Camel, Walter, Rosie and Marlena. The author shows his humanity towards all the menagerie and roustabouts. I read the book before I watched the movie. Which I'm very glad I did. The book takes you on a deeper journey with Jacob at 93 and 23. The movie totally skips over Jacob at the nursing home. They didn't build Jacob at 93 for anyone who'd never read the book to understand him. Had I'd just watched the movie without ever reading the book. I would walk away happy, but in ignorance. I would definitely recommended this book to anyone and would advice to read the book before watching the movie.

I don't think words are beautiful enough to describe this book. I was in love with this from the get go. Throughout this book, I caught myself smiling as I read... full on cheesy smile, as I was totally entranced by the world I was lost in. I also found tears in my eyes over and over- both in joy and sadness. This book tore through me.I can't really review this beyond saying that Water for Elephants was magical. If you have yet to read this (which I highly doubt, considering I am one of the last people on earth to read it), stop everything and go start it now.This is one of those novels that I wish someone had thrust this one on me so I could have experienced the beauty that this story is earlier.

I'll start off by saying I usually sit down to read YA fiction - even though I'm 20 years old. I prefer something light hearted and breezy. I'd seen the movie before I actually picked up this book, But I was so impressed by the movie I decided i'd take the chance to sit back and read it. Let me say it made my morning commute to work far easier. I adore this book and have already passed it on to someone else in my family. It is one of those books that i was thinking was going to be completely different to the movie, and although there are a few sizable differences, it followed the plot extremely well.We first meet Jacob a ninety something withering old man remembering the good old days when he used to be able to do whatever, whenever.. and eat basically anything he wanted. Something the nursing home wasn't allowing him to do, much to his dismay. Flicking back between old Jacob and young Jacob we're presented with some humorous banter before delving into the heart wrenching tale of his life. I felt as though i'd been thrust back in time, and was there along with them at the circus, watching everything fall in to place. It all flowed so smoothly.The author did her research, she slipped right into that era without any troubles and i found it pleasant and enjoyable. A great summer read that leaves you devouring the pages wondering what is going to happen next. I highly recommend reading this. Although there are some scenes entailing sexual content it's easily read over. Water for Elephants is a delightful, delicious read.

I thought this book was wonderful!  I loved the way the author juxtaposes the young Jacob with the older Jacob; such a method has the potential to be jerky or awkward, but the transitions are smooth and the reader can easily manage to keep up with both storylines.Gruen is a skilled storyteller, I was caught from the first page and couldn't put the book down.  I love when a book does that, and makes me both happy and sad, and this book does both of these things at various points.  The most emotional aspect of the book for me was how Jacob felt about being in a nursing home, his frustration at having a "young" mind in an older body, and being treated as though he's senile by the nursing home staff as well as his own family.  This happens a lot in our culture, we tend to pack away the old because we don't want to be reminded of what we will be one day.  Wonderful, wonderful.  5 stars.

I got this book for a free read through my Amazon prime account, not sure exactly what to expect but at times I like to read outside of my normal genres and take a walk on the wild side. I was not disappointed.  This is the story of a man who is looking back on his life and how his actions helped him become the man he became.  After the death of his parents he jumps a freight train only to discover it is a circus train.  He was one exam away from becoming a veterinarian at the time of his families death and his time with the circus not only helped form his view of the world but also his view of mankind and himself.  It was moving, the characters were 3 dimensional and grew during the telling of this tale.  I couldn't put it down.  The ending was very unexpected and I found myself wondering when it was all said and done what happened next.  Although this was not in a genre I normally read I would highly recommend it.  I am an animal lover and his compassion for the beast that were used by the circus was very touching.  I found myself routing for the good guys and hating the bad guys and thinking to myself  I could so see myself doing that.  There are things that happen in everyone's life that shape them, change them and help them become the people they are meant to be. This story will touch your heart and make think back over your own life with new perspective. I give it two thumbs up a must read for anyone who has ever loved and lost or who has wondered what if?  A truly great read.

Possibly the best book I've read in nearly 20 years. An easy, yet difficult at the same time read, I found myself unable to put it down although there were parts so heart-wrenching, my eyes filled with tears throughout this realistically-written novel. Also, the movie based on this book is one of the very few which Hollywood did not completely destroy (but PLEASE read the book first!).And guys, this isn't just some flaky chick-lit...my boyfriend read it with me (HIS idea!), finished it first, then hounded me to hurry up and finish reading it so he could discuss it with me. And he doesn't usually take an interest in anything that's not Lord of the Rings-esque.So, go forth, read and enjoy-I own both the book and the Kindle version-either way, it's a winner.

Water for Elephants takes you to the time of the Great Depression on a circus train.  I was hesitating on reading this story because I thought it would be heartbreaking.  It's hard for me to read about animal cruelty and reading about a circus there is bound to be some ugly scenes.  There are some scenes that were hard to read, but for the most part I felt the author did spare us the raw details.  Sara Gruen knows how to write rich details in such a way that the circus jumped off the pages.  I felt like I was there surround by the sounds and smells of the circus.  I loved the characters and Rosie the elephant was the show stopper.  It was a pleasure reading this story and a huge plus for me that it had a happy ending.

This was a delightful book. I would have never thought a story set in the 30's about a 20year old man who runs away and joins the circus would have kept me interested. This book did. It was nice to get an understanding about how life would have been back then for Circus-folk. I took for granted for many years how a show is produced. It was so descriptive that I could hear the circus music playing.There was a few boring spots, but when the book picks up the tempo, it makes up for the few boring parts. Also I didn't like how the prolog made it seem like Marlena murdered August, when it turns out to be Rosie the Elephant. That was the books Far-fetched moment. The Kindle Version was for some reason, hard to read. They would have 1 word a page. Not sure why. The upcoming movie looks like good. I don't see Reese Whiterspoon as Marlena since of the age difference, but I'm sure it will be a great movie.

The characters in this book just seem fake. They have no real personalities. I have a hard time reading a book when the characters are so one dimensional. The story seems to be contrived because of this.

I'm another reader who can't even begin to understand why this book was so popular, or why people rave about Gruen's writing.  I thought the writing was mediocre at best, and that the plot, narration, and dialogue were BORING!  Plus, the characters aren't very likable, and the frequent graphic sex scenes are completely unnecessary.  I tried to like this book, and I tried to finish it, but I really couldn't, on either count.

Although the book jacket suggested the storyline as a love story, I truly became engrossed in the life in the circus.  After reading the novel, I had to go online and check out historical facts on circus stampedes, fires, and train wrecks. Being a part of the circus family in the 1930's was no easy or safe occupation.The characters are filled with depth, and Jacob, the protagonist, gives the reader a true insight to an honest and loyal man in his twenties and nineties.Maybe it's not always easy to put in words as to the "whys", but it's definitely a book you don't want to put down.

Story OverviewJacob Jankowski is 90--or possibly 93. He's not really sure."When you're five, you know your age down to the month. Even in your twenties you know how old you are. I'm twenty-three, you say, or maybe twenty-seven. But then in your thirties something strange starts to happen. It's a mere hiccup at first, an instant of hesitation. How old are you? Oh, I'm--you start confidently, but then you stop. You were going to say thirty-three, but you're not. You're thirty-five. And then you're bothered, because you wonder if this is the beginning of the end. It is, of course, but it's decades before you admit it."Jacob lives in a nursing home--a bit of a grumpy old man but he does OK overall. He likes to give the nurses a hard time every so often. He resents having to eat Jell-O and the other soft food they try to pass off in the dining room. But his mind is drifting a bit; sometimes he finds himself in vivid dreams--and wakes to find himself unsure of where he is and why he is there. And when a circus sets up shop near the nursing home, Jacob's mind begins to wander more--back to when he was a young man of twenty-three. Back when he knew exactly how old he was. Back when his life lay before him like a blank canvas.He was studying to be a veterinarian. Unbeknownst to Jacob, his parents had mortgaged themselves to the hilt to put him through vet school. The idea was for Jacob to return home and join his father in the family practice--E. Janokowski and Son, Doctors of Veterinary Medicine. But on the brink of graduation, Jacob is called out of class. His parents have been killed in a car accident.  He's alone in the world. He returns home to bury his parents and finds that his legacy--the vet practice--is gone. It is the Great Depression and like others, his parents had fallen on hard times and there is nothing left--the bank claims it all.Although Jacob returns to school to sit for his final exam, he walks out without completing it, follows a road down to the train tracks, and hops onto a passing train--a n action that changes everything. For this isn't an ordinary train--it is the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob has landed on a circus train.A less profitable and more shady circus than Ringling, the Benzini Brothers circus is its own society--populated by two basic social castes: the Performers and the Working Men. They live their lives on the circus train--crisscrossing the country and setting up in various small towns around America. With his veterinary background, Jacob soon finds himself in charge of the menagerie--the collection of animals that perform in the circus. From horses to tigers to monkeys, Jacob cares for the animals with compassion and concern--doing the best he can in difficult circumstances. (After all, when even the men don't get paid some days, there isn't much money for animal food.)He is befriended by a married couple who perform in the circus. Marlena is the beautiful star who performs with the Liberty Horses. August--Marlena's tempermental husband--is the equestrian director and superintendent of animals (in other words, Jacob's boss). Jacob is instantly smitten with Marlena but works hard to conceal his feelings--August has a dark temper that can flare unexpectedly. At first Jacob can control his attraction, but when the circus takes on Rosie--an elephant--things become complicated.The fates of Jacob, Rosie, Marlena and August become forever intertwined--linked together by love, hate, jealousy and violence. How this story plays out forms the core of the book--taking a path that is full of twists, turns and surprises.My ThoughtsSara Gruen does a brilliant job of creating a world that I've never read about before--the world of a traveling circus train in Depression-era America. What a colorful and fascinating setting this was. Gruen does a wonderful job of giving you the feel for a life of a circus worker, and the story is enhanced by the black-and-white photos of actual circus performers from the era. You feel like you're looking at photos of the actual characters that populate the book. In the Author's Note and the accompanying interview, Ms. Gruen talks about her inspiration and research for the book. There are a million little details that give this book such an authentic feel. She really did her homework and it shows. From the words used by the characters to the descriptions of the logistics of the circus to the types of men and women who made their home in what was essentially a traveling, self-contained community, I felt like I was really there on the circus train.Although the heart of the book is what happens to Jacob when he joins the circus, the book alternates between the elderly Jacob in the nursing home and young Jacob in the circus. I thought this juxtasposition worked well (except for the very end--I personally didn't care for the final choice that Gruen made for the elderly Jacob). When the circus comes to town and triggers Jacob's memories, his story unfolds in a natural way--with the reader getting more and more drawn in to Jacob's story as it unfolds in the book and in his memories.In addition, Gruen establishes a framing device in the prologue that influences the reader from the very start of the novel. I found this particular choice extremely effective--and I loved how she pulled it off and tied it together at the end. I love when an author plays with her readers a little bit, and Gruen did a great job in this aspect.If you're looking for a movie to go with the book, I must recommend Dumbo. I kept picturing scenes from that movie as I read the book, and I could completely imagine this story being told in a similar way.My Final RecommendationI definitely see why this book was a bestseller. It offers something for everyone--a unique setting, a bit of history, a romantic triangle, animals, an examination in what it means to grow old. This book effortlessly fits all of this in without seeming forced or strained. And on top of that, it is just a good story that makes you want to find out what happens next. If you haven't read it already, I think it is definitely worth a read. If I was attending the Benzini Brothers circus, I would be standing up and yelling "Encore! Encore!"

I enjoyed being transported to another time and place. To a vivid, colorful existence long gone. I admit, I expected this book to be fabulous, what with the hoopla and the fact that I saw it front and center for so long every time I went inside any bookstore. The writing wasn't why I gave it five stars, but the story and the research was impeccable.

Loved it! This was a really complete story. The characters were fascinating, the setting exotic and the story enthralling from the beginning. The writing didn't get in the way of the story (which I love). I loved the animal characters and their relations with the humans. It had a "Life of Pi" vibe, but was more grounded in reality. I got very attached to the main character as an old man (it jumps back and forth - but not in an annoying way - really lends itself to telling the epic of his life while only delving into a few years of it). The author shows restraint describing any suffering of animals and lowly circus workers - which I appreciate - can't stand when they knock you over the head with it. Very well researched, no boring details - just the good stuff :)

Following a family tragedy, Jacob Jankowski abandons life as a college student, and instead of working as a veterinarian alongside his father, finds himself caring for animals in a traveling circus--the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob befriends numerous characters, from the glamorous performer Marlena, to the alcoholic Camel, who works setting up the circus, to the Benzini Brothers' star elephant, Rosie. As he travels between different castes of the circus and across America, Jacob narrates the triumphs and hardships experienced by the people and animals of the Great Depression-era attraction.Interspersed throughout the novel are chapters that introduce the reader to the present-day, nonagenarian Jacob, as he laments his current living arrangement in a nursing home.Despite several graphic descriptions of animal abuse and the cruelty displayed the novel's antagonists, the story is ultimately fun, escapist and sentimental, with an optimistic, if improbable, conclusion.

Water for Elephants captivates the reader with its deeply moving and touching storyline.It is charming,magical.... laced with sadness,humour,joy. The story of a young man who loses everything dear to him in this world and then finds meaning and happiness in the most unexpected and least likely place....a traveling circus. The book really brings to life the spirit and times of a traveling circus(set in the backdrop of the Great Depression). Its many colorful,unique characters vividly bring to life this largly forgotten bygone era.Water for Elephants is simply a pleasure to read.  The only drawback to the book is that there is quite a bit of cursing and several sexually explicit passages that might offend certain readers.If you can overlook or skip these rough spots you will certainly experience great pleasure in reading Water for Elephants.

Yes, despite disagreeing with my whole book club and from the looks of it, many other amazon reviewers-- I cannot give this book a standing ovation.  I was even reluctant to give it 4 stars-- a high 3 would be more just.  Don't be turned away from this frank begining- I did enjoy the book-- and I can echo the reviewer who noted this as a "great summer read"  It is!  And it was painstakinly researched- you can tell- but for me that was part of the problem.  First off a good summer read is not the same to me as a great read. It was quick, painless, entertaining but I was not invested in the characters.  That is a crucial difference for me.  And while I received quite a good history lesson as regards circuses and other depression era details, I felt at the same time I was reading someones writing exercise or assignment.  There is a feeling of the author making sure she includes all that she has learned about good writing.  But read it you shall, as my review will be outweighed by the others, just don't expect more then a "jolly good time".

I loved this story. I purchased it a while ago when it was on sale and just got around to reading it. The story was memorable and it was fascinating to read and learn about life in a traveling circus in the early 1900's. I immediately looked for other books by this author, but since they weren't rated as well, I haven't gotten around to reading any of those yet.

(Review originally posted at GoneWithTheWords.com)The book begins with ninety year old Jacob remembering a very intense and disturbing event from his time with the circus that will leave you wanting to find out how it got to that point. The chapters then alternate between old Jacob and his very depressed state at the Assisted Living Facility and him remembering his journey with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. The circumstances on how he came to join the circus as the show Veterinarian were very sad. He went from being a young man about to graduate from Cornell, his whole future ahead of him and the possibility of FINALLY losing his virginity, to having no one and nowhere to go.Once on the show, he meets August, the show's equestrian director and superintendent of animals. August is one very questionable character. He can be the most charming man around and moments later he can turn into the most terrifying creature you've ever encountered. He also meets Marlena, August's wife, and falls in love with her on the spot. At a later point, the show aquires an elephant named Rosie who is thought to be stupid because she won't learn to do anything the trainers try to make her do. Rosie plays a huge part in this story, and she gave me the biggest surprise in this book. This story also takes you on an eye opening journey through the sad conditions circus employees and animals were under in 1931.Water for Elephants was a completely different read for me. It was Adult, and it was realistic, and I loved it. I was a little skeptical about the circus theme. Can't say I've ever been curious enough about its workings to read a book revolving around one, but I am so glad I did because it was sooo much more than that! It made me laugh, cry and gasp in astonishment sometimes. It was a huge plus knowing this will be a movie (coming out in April) starring Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon as the main characters. I just pictured both of them the whole time! :D

I was surprised to find that Water for Elephants did not live up to all the hype. In the beginning of the book I was hooked. Jacob Jankowski starts off the story as a man in his nineties reminiscing about his days with The Benzini Brothers traveling circus. Jacob experiences a family tragedy and runs away ending up as a veterinarian with the traveling circus. The animals are mistreated, the workers are mistreated, and the "ring leader" Uncle Al, is an egotistical, greedy SOB that you will love to hate. The things that Jacob witnesses are truly appalling.The research that Gruen did in preparation for this story was definitely the most interesting aspect of the book. However, then comes the middle of the book. I got very bored, and found it hard to finish chapter after chapter. Now having finished the book, I understand that Gruen was just setting up the end of the story. The middle was a  necessary "evil".Without giving anything away, the ending was interesting. Predictable, but interesting. I enjoyed the book because I love the era (early 1930's) and the characters in the book. Read this book but disregard the five star reviews and hype surrounding the book.

I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. I'll probably only give a handful of five-star reviews. This and Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet are my favorite books from what I've read this past year, and I've done a lot of reading.  The story just sucked me in.  Usually when a book goes back and forth between past and present there is one time period I prefer over another.  I will trudge through the less preferred period of time just to get to the better part.  In this book, I enjoyed both past and present equally. It's just well done.

What a beautiful story Sara has woven with "Water for Elephants".  It really made me reflect on how difficult it must be for elderly people to have lost most of their friends and loved ones and how them can only relive the memories of their lives.  This book was captivating--love, adventure,friendship, excitement, betrayal, and the special love between animals and humans--all rolled into one wonderful tale.  From the time I started reading it-it was all I could do to put it down--kept me awake reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore.I will definitely be keeping watch for any new books written by Sara Guren--she is a fantastic story teller.

I am now really interested to learn more about this era of the circus.  I read my copy in 3 days and have already loaned it out.  Trust me, this is a good book!

Who knew the circus could be so full of drama? This book takes place in a time when OSHA wasn't available, before PETA and the like. Sara Gruen does an excellent job walking us through this time, exposing us to the trials of finding yourself. It's more of a story of self discovery with the circus playing second show. Just a great read and perfect for book club.

The book has some good charactors, interesting story line, but some of the charactors seemed a little flat to me.  For example, the roommate in the stock car, I some how felt more connected to him than Jacob. Overall a fun and light read, but just lacking a little depth to the main charactors. I will absolutly read other Sara Gruen, I think she has some good talent as a writer. Just my opinion.

The parts of this book that dealt with the main character in old age, were very insightful and I enjoyed that.  But quite honestly had I known that it would detail the abuse of the circus animals and then also the detailed sex acts I would never had purchased this.  I wish I knew how to delete it from my Kindle.  I also wish someone else had mention this in the reviews that I saw.  I NEVER stop reading a book, but had to quit about 35% of the way thru it, it was disgusting and I am not a prude.I would never recommend this book, nor will I venture to the movie.

I found this book to be between 3 and 4 stars, but closer to a four. The first sentence had a grammatical error, and the descriptions were too involved and wordy, so I was afraid I would be disappointed. I wasn't. It turned out to be a well-written book. Gruen actually took me to the circus world in the early thirties, and I lived it along with Jacob. Not only that, but seeing Jacob in his nineties, gives the reader a new appreciation for the elderly. Although I could have done without the cursing and gritty sex scenes, I still found the book interesting, at times delightful, and well worth the read.

Spolier Alert (kinda): I really enjoyed the reflection of the characters past and present. I found the love story to be a bit wishy washy.  when visting the main characters past I didn't really buy into the &#34;love at first sight&#34; idea. Not sure why, but I was asking why? Why did Marlena fall in love with Jacob? What made him stand out so much? It sounds bad that i say that, but I just didn't feel a spark between the characters. The whole damsel in distress was manufactured. Additionally, it was super convenient the way they ended up together in the end. Overall, I did enjoy the story and I was more drawn to the present version Jacob.

I would like to thank Ms. Gruen for writing such a pleasant tale . I knew a child who once "ran away to join the circus"  and her life did not have as happy of an ending as did Marlena's.  I thought of her often as Jacob's life unfolded and as Rosie saved them all.

Unusual subject and written in first person narrative of a man early and aged.  Amazing feat given that the author is herself a woman.  Story itself is a bit thin and somewhat sinister. Rather strange at times. Overall, I would rate it as instructive about the history of circus  but with some reservation on the storyline.

I was first drawn to this novel based on a short synopsis I had read on Amazon, and after many views decided to buy the novel.  I have never been so pleased with a book purchase as I am with this one.  Just reading the jacket alone draws you in to Gruen's amazing literary ability.  I finished the book about a  month ago, and am now on to Kite Runner, yet I can't help to be disappointed as I keep comparing it to Water for Elephants and am coming up short.  Congrats to Sara Gruen, I am absolutely blown away by how well this woman can not only write, but how easily one can picture the entire novel and feel as though they are right there at the circus.  The last few chapters I found myself both grimacing and smiling - completely drawn into the book and upset that it couldn't last longer.  If there is one book that will stay with you for a long time, I am convinced it is this one.

Jacob Jankowski is a 93-year old man in a nursing home, and very cantankerous. The circus has come to the nursing home residents, and this takes Jacob back in time in the book as he tells his story. The book goes back and forth between the past and present tense.When Jake's parents die unexpectedly in a tragic accident,he is 23-years old and lost now. The house was taken away since unbeknowst to Jake, his parents had been in debt, and the house is taken away, and all because his father couldn't let the animals go hungry. He and Jake were in a veterinary practice together, and now it's all gone. Jake, not knowing what to do, went back to school to finish his final exams. He walks out in the middle of it though, and goes toward the train tracks. He climbs aboard a circus train unknowingly, which is the Benzini Brothers, The Greatest Show on Earth. From then on, his life changes forever.Camel is the older man that takes Jake under his wing, and shows him the ropes more or less. He is given the job of cleaning up after the animals, and later acted as a vet. Jake is introduced to Walter, and at first Walter deeply resents Jake at first, and having to share his quarters with him. But when Jake saves his pet Queenie, the two strike a friendship.The boss, August is a hateful cruel man. When an elephant, Rosie is brought in to the mix, August is absolutely sadistic to that poor animal. Jake saves Rosie from being killed by August more than a few times in the book.And the other part of the story is Marlena, August's sweet wife. Jake falls in love with her almost immediately, and knows that Marlena is miserable with her mentally ill husband. She falls for Jake as well, and when it is discovered that they are sneaking away by August, a horrible disaster strikes, and Jake almost doesn't survive.The book comes to an earth-shattering climax and has quite the ending which is a surprise.

I loved it! Her characters were impressive and her descriptive narrative provides a vivid setting. Both Jacob's young life as a student and a vet for a traveling circus and, as we first meet him, in his 90's in the nursing home are set before you in beautiful, & sometimes heartbreaking detail.Benzini Brother's circus is portrayed in all it's glory and in all it's horror. The Depression era, and circus life at the time, is richly described and well researched. It is a murder mystery whose ending is both surprising and yet somehow righteously predictable. Still,... it was FUN! You see the murder in the beginning, but not until the end when you have all of the story behind you, do you get to see the truth. I cheered, as did many in my book club! We all agreed that we had never LAUGHED when a murderer was revealed in a novel, until Water For Elephants!I suppose that the best way to describe this story is that it is a paradox. Our book club enjoyed it very much, with few exceptions.  It was a surprising story and one that stays with you. You will never look at the circus, or a nursing home and its residents the same way again!

This story alternates between present-day and flashbacks through the mind of our now 93-year-old main character.  The historical aspects of this book are incredibly well-researched and do a great deal to advance the plot of the story.  Unfortunately, the present-day scenes are rather dull.  I found myself skimming over those sections because I was eager to return to reading about Jacob's life working on the circus in the 1930s.The love story in this book - a tale of forbidden love between Jacob and Marlena, the married star of the big top show - is sweet, but ultimately predictable.  With the exception of one sharp twist, I felt that the love story ending of this novel is fairly cookie cutter.  That being said, I can't deny the fact that I was thoroughly entertained by every page.

Gruen's latest is a page turner from start to finish. Jacob Jankowski tells his story both in the form of memories while in a nursing home, and as the real time experiences of a 23-year old failed veterinary student in the midst of the Depression. Failing his exams, Jacob flees home and hooks up with a circus; he survives in this brutal world only because he has some skill with animals. Gruen paints a marvelous, completely believable portrait of a circus of the thirties, where the ruthless Uncle Al rules with the power of life and death. He deviates from planned appearances only to pick up the pieces of other failed circuses. Once someone ceases to be of use to the show, or if the money doesn't roll in as planned, they're gone--sometimes forever. It's a harsh world, but apparently historically accurate. And the old black and white photos at the beginning of each chapter are fascinating! Gruen's meticulous research makes the book--the plot line is a bit predictable and the ending a fantasy. But this is a great summer or airplane read--engrossing but not too heavy. Highly recommended.

Water for Elephants was one of those books that was difficult to put down.  The prose flowed very smoothly. The subject of the circus world during the depression was well researched and make accessible to the reader.  It could be read on many levels, but even a surface level was satisfying.My only problem, as with many best sellers, was that the action was in places not very realistic.  This may be a bit picky, but after suffering from a concussion, nobody is ready to climb on top of a moving train and hop between cars, no matter how pumped they are with adrenaline.  Such lapses in credibility hurt an otherwise wonderful novel.

Water for Elephants is an immensely entertaining, well researched novel.  It's easy to see why this book is so popular.  That said; there are a few short comings, some minor, some more substantial.The research about depression era circus' (not that I profess to be an expert) is excellent and makes a fascinating backdrop to the story.  While the author makes great use of her research, the tone of the novel, particularly the dialogue, is too contemporary to sound authentic.  While this is a fault to some extent, it isn't one that will bother most readers.  In fact, it makes the novel more readable,likely contributing to it's success.  Fans of Faulkner and Steinbeck, of course, may beg to differ.I'm not sure why the author chose to make the novel's principal villain Jewish and allegedly Paranoid Schizophrenic.  The fact that he is Jewish is irrelevant to the plot (aside from the fact that it apparently makes his wife's family more likely to disown her) and his behaviour, while deplorable at times, isn't consistent with Schizophrenia at all.  These may seem like minor points, but they bothered me a little because they play into stereo types and were completely unnecessary.The romance that develops between Jacob and Marlena is predictable and uninspired.  The murder during the stampede is a little too contrived and highly improbable, and the final chapter is a little too sentimental for my tastes.  But despite these grievances, I was won over.The first half of the novel is definitely stronger than the second half.  Gruen's writing style is accessible, entertaining, and often very funny.  Jacob as an old man is cantankerous and vulnerable, and his frustration with growing old is truly heartbreaking.  These `present day' chapters are arguably the strongest in the novel.  While the love story is admittedly unremarkable, it was fascinating to read about life in the circus.  Greun weaves a series of amusing and presumably real (at least according to circus lore) anacdotes into the story.All in all, it isn't hard to see why this novel is a bestseller.  True, the love story is a little flat, but overall, the novel is hard not to like.  Water for Elephants isn't a literary masterpiece, but it's enormously entertaining.  If you are willing to overlook a few faults, it is well worth reading.

This is the incredible story of a man who was forced to say good-bye to the life he knew and expected to have to take a chance on something wild and unpredictable.  This is a story that lets you see the real person that this man becomes- with imperfections and all.  The author does an incredible job of telling the story about this man with a man's voice and perspectives.  The author is a woman and if you didn't notice that- you wouldn't be able to guess that from reading the story.  It is surprising how well she is able to get into the mind of a man.  One thing about this story that I truly loved was that it was told from a "real time" perspective and a future perspective.  We get to see what happens to this man after his long journey.  Plus, we see that that journey never actually ends.  I can't say enough about this book.  It was a pleasure to read each and every word on each and every page.  I give it the highest review.

This book was just pointless. I feel like I was reading a novel generated by a random plot generator which spit out a circus, an old guy and a young guy-- nothing had the tactical feel of reality in this book. It was mediocre at best. Even the title of the novel was anticlimactic, given that one of old Jacob's nursing home fellows said he used to carry water for elephants and then not mentioned again. This novel is devoid of anything making it worth reading: Complex plot? No; Mercurial characters? No; Insights into the human condition? No; Stupendous vocabulary and/or Joycean constructions with the English language? No. Instead, we are left with chapter after chapter of a book better suited as children's literature.

I found this book fairly well crafted, but did not believe in the characters or the story, which seemed awfully thin and contrived. The author admits in a postscript that she borrowed extensively from old newspaper stories and made up composite characters based on real-life people and animals, which is close to plagiarism if you ask me. The main character, Jacob, who is 93, and tell the story in flashbacks, is much too lucid for his age to be credible, and Marlena, the woman he eventually steals, comes across as flat and uninteresting.Like other reviewers, I found the dialogue artificial and at times anachronistic. Haven't seen the movie but not much source material to work with.

I gave this 3 stars only because I did get engrossed with the novel at some point and felt propelled toward the end of the story.  However, everything that others have said about the believability of some of the situations holds true (as in Jacob taking the knife away from Walter when he would need it most).  My main problem with the story was the constant going back and forth from the 90 something character to the young Jacob.  The author didn't make these transitions meaningful in any way.  There was no reason why at some point it switched back in time and then for no reason whatsoever it switched to real time.  And, although I understand people can become forgetful and cranky in their old age, there was no way that the old Jacob was similar to the personality of the young Jacob.  People may get older, but their basic personalities stay the same, and these two Jacobs were totally dissimilar.  And, the author spent too much time in letting us know the horrid aspects of old folks in an old folks home and left us with none of the joys of companionship and the other qualities that people can enjoy in assisted living.  It got to the point where I skipped through the "old" parts, especially because they didn't advance the story line.

My good mate John down at Matilda's book store  in Mount Waverley ordered this book in for me and it would have to be my favourite novel so far this year.The reader is introduced to 90 something year old Jacob who is a resident in an Old Folk's Home. Jacob talks about his past beginning with not completing his Vet Exams and finding himself in a travelling cirus during the Depression Era in America. Beneath the tinsel and cotton candy you find that the circus consists of hard men who never thought twice about throwing anybody from a  moving train.There is brutality and violence in this book and also the search for dignity in this cold tough world. Naturally 5 stars for this book.

The plot is standard "the notebook" territory and so are the characters. This is a romance novel that leaves you hanging when it starts to get good. Its exciting until the 340 page mark, where at some point, you realize there is no extra layer of intelligence guiding the plot, dialogue, or character developement that could turn it into a classic. Later the plot goes completely off the rails and out of the hands of the main character, as people are murdered and "Jacob" himself almost becomes a murderer. This book is mostly dark stuff involving death, sex, and money. At times its cheesy and conservative, unrealistic. Its quite an exciting book and a fast read, but there is a lot more that could have been done. The author is quite talented, and I hope her next book is a classic, but this time she written a somewhat formulaic, generally nasty story here that ends in a wreck. The author cleans up Jacob's dilemnas for him by making the plot complete chaos at the end. A little too lazy for me. The book is standard romance with some problems, unfortunately.

I could write a book about this book but will keep it short and simple.  This book tells a very entertaining story of Jacob (never referred to as "Jake" in the book) and a twist of fate that sees his fate aligned with a circus after his parents are killed.  It's a very engaging book, well written and enough to keep you reading into the wee hours of the night.  I can't imagine the movie could possibly keep up but may give it a shot.  I don't see Robert Pattison as Jacob necessarily.Great book!  And for those who seemed to think the book fell flat - you're digging too deep for meaning - relax and enjoy a good read.

From the moment that Jacob Jankowski hops a ride on a circus train outside of Itaca, New York the story pulls you right into the circus life. A tragic chain of events have caused Jacob to hop on this train, but the ride also causes him to meet the love of his life. The author does a brillant job of telling this story of Jacob's circus life from his own memory at the age of ninty or is it ninty three while recovering in a nursing home. This story in a story is truly delightful how Jacob handles the aging process and the other people in the nursing home. I was very impressed how the author handled the transition between stories. While the circus brought many people laughter and excitment during the "Great Depression" and "Prohibition", I found that the life was very tragic for some of the workers and animals. It was frankly a very hard life.

Simply a great read.  Gruen grabs you from page one, plunks you down into the main character's universe (alternately a present-day nursing home and the depression-era circus).  You care. You ride up and down with him, and experience everything first hand.This is a great story blending historic facts (at least, facts in an anthropological kind of way - she did her research for sure) and great fiction. She uses the flashback as a vehicle perfectly, blending the main character's present-day circumstances with his past, lending a gravitas to his current feelings and actions that draws you in and holds you tight.I must admit, the very ending was a bit of a stretch on the imagination, but by that time I had tears in my eyes and was willing to suspend a bit more disbelief than I normally would.  I was sad to see this end.Kindle purchases be forewarned: each chapter has an historic photo from the circus; they show up OK on the screen, but the paper print might show this better.  I didn't have a major problem with it (the convenience of the Kindle outweighs the slight fuzziness of the images' resolution), but it is worth mentioning.

Tapping into a unique and compelling piece of Americana, Sara Gruen has created an entertaining novel under the big top of the traveling depression-era circus. Cutting in and out of the present, the novel's 90- (or 93-) year-old narrator, Jacob Jankowski, brings us into both his life in a nursing home and his incredible 3 and a half months many years ago as the "vet" of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Like Salieri in "Amadeus," Jacob views his past as if happening in the moment, and we are treated to a host of nasty and pathetic as well as complex and individualized characters who live from stop to stop along the rail lines and entertain in towns small and large for the "rubes."Although this set-up is terrific, the love story around which the novel turns is thin and familiar, and the writing, somewhere around page 250, becomes repetitious and uninteresting. Even so, this quick read is well worth the time as an entertainment. I have no doubt, as well, that Hollywood will pick up on this work, as it lends itself completely to a 3-star movie. It's got love, it's got hate, it's got tears, and it's got laughter. And what a field day Hollywood will have with Rosie, the good-hearted Polish pachyderm who cracks open the plot and is nothing but adorable.

Water for Elephants is a superb book with a great beginning, a great middle and a great end. This book is surly destined to be on the "required reading list" along with books such as The Great Gatsby, The Red Badge of Courage and Hemingway's best.The book begins when Jacob, the hero, looses his parents to an accident at the time he is scheduled to sit for his final examine at Cornell University and become a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. Under duress and without finishing the exam, he walks out of the exam building and into a tumultuous life with the circus.At the age of 90, Jacob finds himself in an assisted care facility where he blows his top when a fellow senior, a lawyer, claims to have worked for the circus and delivered water for elephants. Thus begins the story of Jacob's life as a vet for a disreputable circus owner, a novel that ends as Rosie, the elephant in the story, dispatches the evil ring master.From incident to incident, the mind-capturing story flows from rich characters making this book one for the ages. Tis a great read.

Jacob Jankowski's parents perfunctorily die in the opening of this mawkish melodrama, and Jacob drops out of vet school and runs away to join the circus, where he finds fast work as a veterinarian for a menagerie of anthropomorphic animals. Jacob also finds romance (not with the animals), adventure and a real Snidely Whiplash of a villain. Sara Gruen copies the manipulative, crowd-pleasing instincts of Stephen King and Ron Howard without displaying any of the personality seen in those men's work. She writes in a bland, transparent, easy-to-read prose of cliche, predictability and cheap sentiment. This is the kind of book you can read in a single afternoon without ever having to pause to think. It goes down like a bag of circus cotton candy, and it's about as nourishing. Strictly LCD entertainment. It's like "Titanic" at the circus! It's like "Seabiscuit" with an elephant! After reading one of the most ludicrous endings ever written in the history of populist claptrap, I think I'm being more than generous with my two stars. To the critics who overpraised "Water for Elephants," I offer this quote from the novel: "Surely you can't all be happy with this ... this ... pap?"

The strength of the book is its narrative flow. I particularly liked the little catch-words that usually connected the "assisted living" chapters with the circus chapters. Gruen generally wrote in such connections, and I found them both ingeniously crafted and useful in uniting the narrative.In addition to telling a great story, Gruen gives a remarkably detailed picture of the circus world of the 1930s. I had definitely never heard of a "cooch tent" before reading this book, for example, and Gruen's depiction of its solo practitioner is thoughtful, humane, and free of cliches. The ideas of circuses getting booted out of town, of people getting booted off the circus trains, and of entrepreneurs cannibalizing the remnants of failed circuses were also quite fascinating.To the extent that Gruen wanted to make an analogy to the biblical Jacob story by obscurely dropped hints and anagrammed names, I think, however, that she pushed too far. This novel stands nicely on its own without this type of symbolism or metaphor.

Sara Gruen seems like a nice person. But this novel is total dreck. The structure reeks of baloney, the "different" characters are written with the same bland voice, and the whole melodramatic mess never rises above laughable soap operatics. I'd never want to take enjoyment of this kind of thing away from anyone, but if you've not read it, I'm sure there are better books about the circus out there for you.

I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun book that keeps the reader coming back for more. It is an absolute roller coaster of human emotion that develops characters that are identifiable. Gruen's "warts and all" approach to character development makes the story fell real and compelling. Excellent, well written book! A must read!

Wow! This book was on my To-Read list for awhile before I got around to it. Somehow I didn't foresee this being about the circus, I don't know why. I read this in 2 days, I couldn't put it down. I just wanted to know what happened next! I love the way it was written too. The cruelty of the circus animals brought tears to my eyes more than once. Loved it and will recommend to it my friends for sure!

Beautifully written with characters that define humanity with their strengths but more so their weaknesses, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a most touching tale that brings the reader into a completely different and lost world of the travelling circuses during the Great Depression.What makes Sara Gruen's novel all too unique is her ability to bring us into the lives of her ordinary characters leading such extraordinary existence in the circus world.  Amidst the spectacle to provide temporary entertainment lies the cruelty and the debauchery never seen outside the performance area. A grumpy dwarf and his pet, an elephant who exhibits exceptional talent and is more human than the people around her ... a circus star and a would-be vet ... who would have thought that an insight into their lives can so summarize the abandonment of youth ...and the sadness of old age reviewing an existence that has come to pass?One of the most worthwhile reads for quite a time, this novel is a gem.

After hearing so much hype about this book I quickly read it before the movie came out. I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't the super excited about it either. I liked the perspective from which the story was told - a feisty 90-something old man reflecting in flashbacks on his adventures in a travelling circus 70 years earlier, while lamenting the indignities of his current nursing-home existence.  Jacob Jankowski, just days from the final exams at Cornell University becoming a vet, had his world forever altered when his parents are killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, the 23 yr. old hops a train, never intending to &#8220;run away with the circus&#8221;. Harsh conditions at the circus and an insane animal trainer are some of the things Jacob has to contend with living his life with the circus.

Our Kindle Book Club gave this book 7 out of 10.  I liked the way Gruen brought a life together and illustrated the ways we gain respect and lose respect.  The history of the Circus life was based on fact, it showed the degree of cruelty toward animals and humans in the desire to make money. There was also a degree of cruelty and lack of respect in the Nursing Home. The love story was nicely developed without becoming the main story.  We loved Jacob he was a good man.  The ending was brilliant, he won!

This is the life of Jacob Jankowski, starting after the death of his parents... his parents who paid for his education by mortgaging their farm and therefore had nothing to leave him.He hops a train to nowhere so he thinks...but it is a circus train and he becomes a 'first of May'...that means a newbie. From that time on that is his home, his work, his life.The story is self-narrated by Jacob when he is in his ninties and in an 'old folks home' and he hates every minute of his life there. And so perhaps we can imagine he passes the time by telling us his story.Gruen has circus life down pat due to I am sure many, many hours of research and has such a beautiful rhythm to her prose that you are there with Jacob. You feel the exitement, smell the animals, hear the band music, envision the clowns, hear the roar of the cats and feel the thumder under your feet as the elephants begin their parade... and the laughter and applause of the crowds.Jacob's life is not easy but it is intriguingly exciting and different. IF only he had taken the last test for his vet license...if only his parents had not died at that critical moment in his life...if only...if only...I loved this novel because it drew on every one of my emotions and satisfied my hunger for a really good story. I will never forget Jacob!

Here is a delicious journey back to a gritty bygone era of big tops, roustabouts, circus trains, freak shows, midways.  Many of the extraordinary incidents in this novel, according to the author's notes, are rooted in oral history or based on anecdotes or actual written reports of those early 20th century years.  Those who rode the circus rails, many being family castaways and society's rejects, found family and home in that unique traveling milieu of humanity and managerie, and, in the process, grew tough in body and spirit.  BUT, even if you don't give a hoot about circuses or circus people, don't be put off by the title or theme.  (Although, is there really anyone in their 30s plus years who did not, as a child, sit and watch wide-eyed, delighting in the cheap glitz, the pulsating music, the flamboyant and rhinestone-studded costumes and, yes, the size and smell of the elephants, when the circus came to town?) This story is nostalgic in its telling, engaging in its characters, with a plot that clearly aligns the good guys against the bad.  There are wonderful descriptions of authentic circus activity, on-site intrigue, and a romance that you will really care about.  All of this, tucked into the ruminations of a contentious 90-year-old "assisted-living" resident whom you will also really care about.I suspect, however, one would have to have a soft spot for animals to want to open this novel and then to inhale it, as I did, in just a day and a half.  Like savoring a wonderful dessert, I was torn between the discipline of consuming it in small lady-like portions and making it last for as long as possible or just gobbling it down and enjoying it all at once.

I loved this book! I couldn't put it down! It was a bit "fluffier" reading than I originally thought it would be, but it was fabulous none-the-less. The descriptions are vivid, not cliched; the characters are interesting; and the weaving of present-day Jacob with the Jacob of a bygone era is delightful.I would call this a must read... not because it will change your life or make you think about the world around you, but because it is just so enjoyable. I gave it a 4.5 because it isn't a book that will make you think long after the last page is read, but it will make you sad you've left the colorful circus world of Jacob Jankowski.

I had heard of this book for awhile and kept considering it but I hate to say it wasn't until I saw the trailer for the movie coming out soon that really caught my attention. So the next day I went out and bought it, starting it immediately. The story is extremely well written, with details that enabled me to picture how everything appeared in a big top circus during that time. You immediately connect with Jacob from the start as his journey continues, pulling for him page after page. The other characters are well written with the story, feeling the happiness, joy and sadness each of them feel as the story continues.It's really hard not to say too much without giving the story away. This is a book I will be recommending to everyone as it is a story that has a bit of everything wrapped into one- so many emotions page after page. Knowing the fate of most the characters at the end, you want more but already have an idea of how their story ends.

College guy joins a travel by train circus and flips over the beautiful star married to a jealous, sadistic husband.  The first person point of view makes his crushing on her vivid.The author's historical research adds fascinating info.  She does not hold back on the sex or violence.  The characters are outsized; good idea for a circus story.This is one of the most entertaining novels I've ever read.

I was excited to read this book, but I was disappointed in it. Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a "90 or 93 year old man" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works. It is clear she did a lot of research on how the circuses worked, and it was nice to be able to picture those details.The book had so much potential. I wish it would have been better.

So, this is the dreck that is passing for 'modern literature' these days? Honestly, after hearing some very good reviews about this books (actually, the reviews came to me via a co-worker who pressed a hand to her stomach, frowned and said, "my daughter and I loved this book") I figured I would give it a try.The first sign that this was not going to wind up on my favorite book list was that after an hour or so of reading, I realized that I was more than 100 pages in. Normally when I'm reading, I pause occasionally to think, reflect, sympathize, emphasize, synthesize, etc, etc, etc. But alas, nothing deep and worthy of reflection was to be found. Nothing to stop me reading for a moment to think about what I'd just read. Not that I was expecting much, but I find myself more appreciative of a book, story, news article, movie or television show if it can make me think about at least something more than the words in front of my face. Again, not here. There was nothing to be found.Eventually, as the story continued and I learned more about Jacob and the circus, I can't say I was surprised when I found myself not caring one way or the other what was going to happen to him, or the rest of the circus bunch - there was nothing for me to connect myself to these characters with. If anything, the more I read, the more impressed I became with the author's ability to keep me so detached!In addition to the weak and utterly predictable story, (I mean, who didn't see that August was either bi-polar or a schizophrenic, that Marlena was going to get pregnant, or that Jacob's family wasn't going to show?), the dialogue comes out incredibly thin - to the point that I'm actually thinking that the author has never heard two people speak to one another. The dialogue comes across as forced and, for lack of a better term, soap opera-ish. I half expected to hear the dramatic soap opera bumper at the end of each chapter "will Jacob get the girl, will August find out about their illicit love affair and will Rosie finally learn English? Tune in next chapter.."But I digress. For everything I've stacked in the negative column about this book, there is one redeeming quality - and that is the story. I'm (somewhat) not ashamed to admit that I literally couldn't put this book down. It was like literary candy on a rainy day (actually a smoky day here in So-Cal). I picked up the book at 8am and set it down again around 10pm (having stopped for food, news updates, etc). Needless to say, I was disappointed.Overall, a good book for when you require some mindless entertainment - like sitting in an airport, or on death row.Finally, I was not impressed with the authors use of 'authentic circus lingo.' Apparently, she did some research. Well, I should hope so!

I'm not going to outline the story, I'm going to point out a few flaws in the book and what I liked, to try to help you decide if you should read it for yourself.First, the flaws.  It really doesn't take long to figure out where the story is going.  You can see it coming a mile away.  Second, Ms Gruen is writing the story from a male perspective, but she needs a little more practice.  Jacob seemed like a mama's boy, but I don't think that was her intention, instead it was her inability to really connect to her male character.Despite these minor flaws I found the story engrossing and from my male perspective I didn't think it ever got into 'romance novel' territory.  So guys, it's safe to read.  The trains, boozin' and rough living of a traveling circus in 1931 was very interesting.  The way Gruen shifts the novel from the past to Jacob's current state of living in a nursing home is jarring and makes you feel just like Jacob when he is 90, or 93, you want to get back to the circus.

I enjoyed this book so much, I did not want the story to end.  Alternately told between the main character as a youth and reminiscing as an old man.  This takes you back to a time when the world was a lot simpler, if you remember the time when a circus would show up in your small town and just as quickly disappear.  The end is a gem, won't spoil it for those who have not read it.  I couldn't put it down, just pure entertainment.

Have you ever asked yourself these questions? "What is a life worth? How do you judge if someone is worth saving? What does it mean to be human? What distinguishes an animal from a human being?" Hidden beneath this easy-to-read though dark coming-of-age romance is a theme that prompts the reader to ask the above questions. The answer come through the reminiscing of protagonist Jacob Jankowski--a man at the end of his fascinating life. The story begins with the circus rolling into town, triggering a flood of Jankowski's memories, full of pleasure, joy, love, hate, regret & guilt. Sara Gruen brings the quaint circus existence of the mid 20th century to life through meticulous research and wonderful storytelling. Anyone who ever dreamed of running away to the big top or just dreamed of running away should read this book.

What a wonderful story of a rag-tag bunch of people and animals, who just happened to be called a circus!  They traveled by train during the depression and had some fascinating adventures along the way.  We meet Jacob Jankowski, a young man who accidently lands  on the train.  He decides to stay and become the circus veterinarian.  He meets lovely Marlena and her evil husband, August.  Of course he falls in love with her, but the husband is a force to be reckoned with.  There is also Walter (Kinko)the clown, Big Al, Camel, and of course Rosie the Elephant.  The ending is extremely satisfying.  This book is well-researched and authentic.  I loved it!

A family disaster sends a first generation Polish-American almost-veterinarian down an alternate, precarious path; one filled with, among other things, murder, mayhem, mental illness, a menagerie, and an intriguing woman names Marlena. After the teaser of a prologue, during which a murder takes place, the story shifts to real-time in the life of ninety or ninety-three year old nursing home resident Jacob Jakowski, as he realizes that a circus has rolled up mere blocks away. He is resigned to suffering through several standard days of monotony - wakefulness alternating with bouts of night-time and inadvertent, memory-filled dozing as he anticipates viewing the upcoming circus performance. Although his brain founders, his wit and wisdom-filled thoughts and words are spot on: of memory "You start to forget words: they're on the tip of your tongue, but instead of eventually dislodging, they stay there," forced to take an antidepressant, "You want to drug me. You want to turn me into a Jell-O eating sheep," on nursing home life, "I'm so used to being scolded and herded and managed and handled that I'm no longer sure how to react when someone treats me like a real person," and after explaining his inability to keep track of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, "My brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges." The story of his circus-related escapades is equally good. Although the ending seems more contrived than likely and the plot contains a fair amount of sexual situations, violence and animal cruelty, its uniqueness as well as several fact-based plot parts overshadow its few faults. Good books with similar themes: Life of Pi by Yann Martel, The True History of the Elephant Man by Peter Ford and Michael Howells, and All Creatures Great and Small by James Herriot.

Well I think the sign of a good book is when you put it down and you are still thinking about the characters or the storyline because you can't get them out of your head.  That was definitely true of this book!I had heard and read a lot about Water for Elephants which actually put me off reading it as It meant my expectations were sky high and I wasn't sure if the book would be able to live up to them.  But let me tell you that it certainly did.I was a little apprehensive about how it started, with Jacob in his golden years reflecting on his youth, but in the end I found this was actually one of the things I enjoyed about how the book was written.  Like Jacob, I longed for the times when his mind slipped back to his younger years when his body was whole and his mind sharp, when his passions ran high and his life was full of adventure.  I could relate to his frustration with his age, mental status and physically limitations.The story of his life was emotional, and felt very real.  The ending was surprisingly satisfying for the reader and Jacob, possibly because Jacob received what we all hope for at the end of a long life.  I'm not going to say anymore than that, as i dont want to give anything away so if you want to know more you will have to read it yourself.  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.

This is a good book about the circus (a comment I never thought I would ever make).  Jacob's story is heartbreakingly sympathetic.  Ms. Gruen's mastery of the circus vocabulary really sets the stage for the plotline.  A remarkable amount of reseach went into writing circus lore.  This is no Barnum and Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth.  This is a downtrodden, edging ever closer to disaster circus run by the same type of people.  I must admit I had to skip anything that resembled animal cruelty (although I am sure it is factual).  My inability to deal with this led to my giving the book only 4 stars.  A reflection on the reviewer more than on the book.

It took me a long, long time to get into this book.  I kept picking it up, reading a few pages and then putting it down again.  It wasn't terrible, but it didn't really grab me until well after the 100 page mark.  Nevertheless, I did enjoy it and I'm glad I stuck with it.The book jumps backwards and forwards in time from Jacob's life as a vet in a 1930s circus to his life today as a 93 year old in an old folk's home.  Not much happens in the present day chapters and for a while I wondered what they were adding to the book, but the pay off at the end is very satisfying.  While I don't know a lot about circuses in the depression era, my impression was that the book is well researched and certainly it brings that world very vividly to life.  The book is peppered with sepia toned photographs from that era which is a clever touch.Overall a good book and one that is worth sticking with.  I was caught up in the central romance and I very much enjoyed the character that is the elephant, Rosie.

This was a delightful summer read. Everything about this book was good. You could really identify and feel passionate (good or bad) about the characters, including the animals. All the loose ends are wrapped up. It makes me feel nostalgic and she has a way of transporting you back in time without being too wordy. The book is well written and entertaining. This was pretty  much the best book I read all summer. I even cried a little at the end. :) I really hope they make this book into a movie. It would be such a great movie if it was done correctley. Everyone should read this book.

I fell in love with Jacob Jankowski even if he is 90.... or 93!I ordered this book through my online bookclub "Audible" and am so glad I did.The cover of the book interested me and I had almost bought the book to read but thought.... naw I am really not into the whole circus thing. Besides, I am more of a Non-Fiction kinda gal lately.Then a few days later this book was listed on Audible  as one of their bestsellers so I gave it a try and immediately fell in love with the narration of old man Jacob.  The story drew me in and I couldn't stop listening to it... even after we had all gone to bed I was up past 2am last night listening to it trying to control my laughter at the really laugh out loud parts to keep from waking my husband.Now to me that is a really great read so I thought I would pass along a little note saying how much I enjoyed "Water for Elephants: A Novel" and to say thanks to Sara Gruen for writing it!I enjoyed the Awesome Narration also by David LeDoux and John Randolph Jones that really added to the enjoyment of this novel!!!

This book was amazing. The pace is almost like the circus train itself: it starts chugging forward slowly and then before you know it, you're flying so fast you can barely keep your balance! Gruen's writing is so evocative -- you feel like you are on that train and in those tents. You taste the food, smell the smells, hear the sounds, feel the animals and the movement of the train. It's amazing that she could write so vividly about an era in history with which she had no prior knowledge before writing the book.The only thing I didn't like about it were the scenes involving animal cruelty. I knew they would be there, given the subject matter, but it was still difficult. However, I give Gruen credit for not making them gratuitous. They were important to developing the story line and the characters.All in all, a great ride!

Waited awhile to read this book and a friend recommended it to me...so I thought...why not? I loved the story of the circus and felt like I could picture everything. It was a very, easy read and found myself wanting to have more time to enjoy it :) Now, what are YOU waiting for?

The title of my review pretty much says it all. This was a very easy, enjoyable read full of characters you can't help but love - and love to hate. There were some inconsistencies in details, but most of them would sail right past the average person and weren't a big deal to me.It is almost always hard for me to initially get into a book, I don't know why, but it is. This book was different, it had my rapt attention from start to finish - though the end was disappointing to me. After chapters of such a great story, I found the almost ridiculous improbability of the ending to be quite out of place. I also could have happily lived without the animal abuse and the unnecessary deaths of Walter & Camel, but the ending sat particularly poorly with me. In addition, the final chapter seemed to bring the previously well paced story to a very abrupt halt that felt all wrong. I enjoyed the rest of the book, however, and feel it's well worth the read.

Books are always better than the movie, and that's true for this one.  The choking scene in the movie upset me greatly (having been a victim of domestic violence), so I was glad it was not in the book (it was referred to, but a pulling of her necklace rather than the full-on, two-hands choking scene of the movie.  Love this one, as well as Gruen's other books.

When my friend first mentioned I should read this book, I hesitated because of the subject of animal abuse. But I did read it and from the beginning was drawn in by the old man as he begins to tell his story. The story is so deeply sentimental and vivid in descriptives. The characters are unforgettable and this includes the animals. Yes it was painfully sad and I was angered when the abuse was occurring but still I read on. I must say this book made a big impression upon me as far as a story of adventure, travel, history and love all rolled into one. When I had my first book read for my debut novel on Friday, June 13th, 2008 the store manager (who took a chance on an unknown self-published author) predicted that my book, like "Water for Elephants", would have the same impact in time. She had said that Sar Gruen at first couldn't get the attention her book deserved but on went life to where WFE ended up being one of the most interesting accounts of US circus story ever told.  Although I saw no comparison with WFE and my novel, The Skye in June, I welcome her prediction and await the results. But! Buy WFE and like me, keep it in your library to reread in the years to come.

Wow! Water for Elephants was recommended by a friend of mine. She loved the book so much, she bought it for me. I am happy she did!! This story was heartfelt, mind blowing, awesomely good!!!!!! Sara definitely has a masterpiece on her hands. Jacob and Marlena' s life, Rosie, all the crew, and other animals. What they went through and how they end up. I loved and cried. Camel and Walter, so sad. Water for Elephants is A must read!!!!!!!

This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have to admit I did not finish it. It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot. Don't waste your time.

It honestly took me weeks to finally talk myself into buying this book, I just said screw it and did it. I started reading it and could not put it down. By far my favorite book. (this month anyhow) I love to read the books before I see the movie and even though 9 out of 10 times I am very disapointed with the movie I honestly can not wait to see this movie! I think that the book was so real and made me feel like part of the circus so much that watching the movie will make me feel even more so part of the circus. I passed this book along to a "reading buddy" of mine and told her just read it! She text me the next day and said she had just finished it and it was SOOOOOO GOOD (This girl in not one to read a book in a day) If you are reading these reviews trying to descide weather to buy this or not by suggestion is.... Just buy it! Well worth the money!

I read this book at the recommendation of a client...I loved it!  I read this book quite some time ago about two years ago and still think about some of the characters.  While reading this book, I often found myself so deep in the story, I could smell the smells and hear all of the people talking.  I want to see the movie as I am sure it will be entertaining, my only concern outside of the obvious, (if you read a lot you will agree it is a rare movie that can compare to the book).  I  so enjoyed this book and I would be disappointed if the characters were not portrayed as beautifully on the big screen as I have them in my mind.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a beautifully written story that is sure to stay with you long after the final page.

It appears as though I'm in the minority once again.  All of us are entitled to our own thoughts and opinions but for the life of me I can't understand the number of 5 star ratings given to this book.  I'm not even sure I feel good about giving it a two.I wanted to like the book.  Really.  Who doesn't love a cute, little, old man telling his story of the good ol' days?  But as endearing as the concept was, I couldn't get past the fact that I honestly didn't care that much about any of the characters.  Sorry but it had to be said.  The characters were flat, the story was more fantasy than fiction and worst of all, the whole thing felt quite familiar.  It was only later that it occured to me that this story was trying very hard to be Fried Green Tomatoes and/or Driving Miss Daisy; the difference is that I actually cared about the characters in those stories.  Frankly, Water for Elephants read more like a screenplay than a great novel.For my friends, I would suggest:If you want a story of reflection - The Green Mile, Driving Miss Daisy, Fried Green TomatoesIf you want a story about elephants - Hannah's DreamIf you want a story about a circus - well, I've got no idea.  :)Having said all of that, I would like to see the movie.  As stated before, this read like a screenplay -- bare bones, generally just waiting for someone to bring life to the characters and story.

When I first started hearing the buzz about this book, I politely declined offers  to "buddy read" and group discuss. I've never been attracted to all that goes on under the "big top;" and, if I didn't want to attend a circus, then why would I want to read about one? The book had the added downfall of an elephant as a main character and while I love animals, I generally don't like to read about them. I thought this book had nothing to offer me . . . and I was very wrong.Reliving his young years right along with 90 year old Jacob Jankowski was a beautiful journey. I normally don't care for the sentimentality inherent in an old narrator looking back on his young days, but I found Water for Elephants didn't use cheap tricks to manipulate the reader's feelings. Instead it had a slow build and satisfying finish - marks of a novel well written. As the old man (Jacob) tells his story, I began to feel all the emotions that he did. By the end, I was fully invested.Gruen brings to life - the Depression era geeks and freaks of the circus with generous but not overdone descriptions.  I became so engrossed in that world that it was jarring to come back to reality when I closed the book. The love triangle between man, woman and beast was a beautiful thing and the ending for me came far too soon.I highly recommend Water for Elephants for 16+ and for anyone who enjoys a beautiful love story and being transported to a different day and age.

I loved this book.  It was sometimes hard to read, when Rosie the elephant was being beaten, for example, but overall, it was so incredibly good.  One point that bothered me, though.  WHY did the author NOT have Jacob turn back and look for Walter???  Just because the other men said he "probably did not survive the night" does not mean he didn't.  At very least Jacob SHOULD have gone back and found out for sure, especially since Walter had done a lot of good for him.  That was the only part of the book I felt let down by, although I still loved the book.

I dont need to go into too much detail, as most of the reviews here have covered the plot.  I downloaded this on my kindle app during a horrendous layover at the airport, and it was nice read that kept my interest.  For some reason this book reminds me of Mitch Albom, in the style it was written and the flashbacks.  Looking forward to the movie, as I had envisioned the main character Marlena to look very similar to Reese Witherspoon during my read.  Pictures kept the chapters interesting as well.

I loved this book. It's about an lonely old man in a nursing home who's memories are sparked with the circus comes to town. He remembers back to his youth when he left veterinary school because of his parent's tragic deaths and joined the traveling circus. He details his unique experiences in the traveling show and of all the colorful people he became friends and enemies with. As mentioned in the title, there is an elephant, but the story is really about a young man's experiences as he struggles and learns his place in the hierarchy of circus and in life. Highly recommended!

I found this book interesting because of the research Ms. Gruen obviously did on train circuses and depression-era life.  I also thought her passages detailing the life of Jake as an old man were the best written things in the book.  Since Ms. Gruen is a woman who appears (from her author's photo) to be barely middle-aged, I have to assume that some research went into finding out about the lives of elderly men as well, because she writes these passages with a clear and utterly believable voice that truly resonates.Unfortunately nothing else in the book resonates nearly as much, and there's a lot lacking here.  The young version of Jake never takes off as a character, nor does his entirely manufactured love story with a circus bareback rider.  We know from the moment he sees Marlena that she'll obviously be his love interest, but their relationship never actually develops before they're suddenly declaring love for one another and hitting the sack.Ms. Gruen also fails in her execution of believable villains.  Her two main villains are August, a brutal horse trainer who abuses or neglects all of the animals, and "Uncle Al", the cruel circus boss, but their villainy never really jumps off the page.  For some reason, she chose to make her main antagonist (August) Jewish.  I still don't understand the reasoning behind that, nor do I understand her choice to call him a paranoid schizophrenic as well.  Oh and for good measure, he's also a wife beater.  He's simply too many things rolled into one.  Perhaps if she'd concentrated on one aspect of his brutality, she could have made him more believable.  And unfortunately, since his religion really has nothing else to do with him as a character, it's hard not to simply label Ms. Gruen as anti-semitic.  Perhaps if she'd actually used the "show, don't tell" philosophy and let us SEE what Uncle Al was doing instead of just hearing about everything second hand from other characters, he wouldn't have seemed so two-dimensional.  As it is, I never bought these guys as the towering pillars of pure evil they were obviously supposed to be.I also never bought Jake, at least not as a young man.  One minute he's making a vow to himself that he'll stay with the animals so they won't be hurt, because that's what his dead father would want him to do.  Yet, he stands by not once but TWICE and allows August to savagely beat an elephant with a hook.  It's hard to respect a character like that.  Jake rarely takes any real action; he mostly just stands by while things happen TO him or happen *around* him.I also felt the book could have benefited from a diagram.  In books that take place on ships, there's usually a sketch in the front of the book with all the parts labeled for readers to refer back to so they can understand the action.  I had a lot of trouble visualizing the train where  a good 40% of the crucial action takes place in this book, and that was a major barrier to getting into the story.  Had there been a sketch of it up front with all the sections labeled, those sections of the story would have been much easier to understand.Overall, I am giving this book three stars because of the research, the informative author's note at the end, and the sections with Jake as an old man.  I also really got a kick out of the ending.  But on the whole, I would recommend this as a library book or a used book store book -- definitely NOT one you pay full price for.

This is a great book to get lost in. The characters are well developed and you can see the story the author is tells about life during the great depression working in a circus.  It's about people who are down on their luck that come together to help others and the animals.  It's one of those rare books when your lucky enough to find one that's hard to put down. Great fiction with a historical basis that lends credibility.

I purchased this book because it received great reviews from readers on amazon.com.  Truthfully, I was disappointed because I found the book rather dull.  There was very little action in the novel and I did not emphathize with any of the characters other than Jankowski in his 90s in the assisted living facility.  The insight provided into the "circus world" of the Great Depression was interesting, but overall, I would not recommend the book.

This book intrigued me because it is not something I'd normally be interested in reading. I was expecting to be "moved"--as so many reviewers had indicated. Instead, I was only "moved" to flip the pages as quickly as possible to at least come to the surprise ending that was indicated in some reviews.The premise, the whole idea of a story set in a circus backdrop during the Depression, was fantastic. The story itself, in my opinion, failed. It failed for several reasons. The characters appeared to be no more than pawns for moving the story forward--they never made it beyond the cardboard cliche stage. Even Jacob, whose latter years were more endearing to read, was always seen from afar. We never really got in his head at all. He was totally unbelievable. Kid drops out of vet school and joins the circus and acts like a thirteen year old with thirteen year old dialogue.Which brings me to the dialogue in this book. Horrible! I caught myself laughing out loud, in disbelief at the cheezy sentences. And at one point I thought if I read "uh" or "um" one more time I was going to scream and toss the book in the trash.All that aside, if it was meant to be just a gaudy quick genre-type read, then it wasn't marketed that way. No one ever rose above the surface level, and I simply didn't buy it--the narrator, the girl, the speech during that era.The ending, well, it was okay. It meshed with the rest of the book.And Jacob, he seemed terribly stupid and sophomoric to be a lifetime vet who'd attended Cornell, etc. He was also grouchy and not likable, except when he finally got real about himself growing old. In fact, I came across this passage in ch. 16, "...my brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges..." I thought YES!! This is what the story is really about: a man who once had keen senses and awareness, and traveled with a circus of all things, has come to the end of the "show" and he is facing it and fearing it simultaneously. That was the story Gruen could've warmed my heart with instead of the basic, shallow, ridiculous story in Water for Elephants.

The latter day Jacob made me sad.A book I will recommend to many.

"Water for Elephants", by Sara Gruen is a compelling read that is fast-paced and difficult to put down. At times the plot ran so quickly I found myself trying to search for a way to slow down the course of the story, but to no avail. The quick pace, however, does seem to fit and reaches a broader audience that seems to want rapid conclusion and catharsis. Reversions to the present time are a nice break from circus life and I believe are Gruen's most vivid and compelling depictions of the novel. Her illustration of life at the nursing home and perspective of the `patients' which Jacob catches a nurse stating when the correct political term is `residents' provides an accurate and refreshing look at assisted elderly homes. The circus lifestyle is portrayed truthfully, but is often overshadowed by the dynamics and major plot-line concerned with the Romantic relationship and triangle of Jacob, August, and Marlena.Gruen's, "Water for Elephants", is an easy read with relatively simple themes and motifs to comprehend including: animal cruelty, abusive relationships, circus life in the 30's, life during the Great Depression, coming of age, and older age/aging. It truly encapsulates a broad range of topics, but the overlaying plot and issues are prevalent and riveting, if a bit rushed.

I'd probably never have picked up this book on my own, but it was chosen by a book club I've been coerced into joining.  It was an enjoyable book and very quick to read.  It's the story of a young man who accidently joins a mangy circus during the depression following a personal tragedy, and grows up in the process.  The background of the circus, particularly at this time in recent history, was vivid and fascinating, and it would be worth reading the book for that alone.

The ending was disappointing for me.

One of the things that makes the book so strong is the characters. from Jacob to August to "Rosie", there isn't a character that I did not feel moved by at one point or another.There is a dark side to the circus life and this book will show you things you never imagined that happen outside the Big Top. So, if you are going to buy one book this year, make it this one.

Although this is a work of fiction, author Sara Gruen did extensive research into the circus world during the Depression years.  She weaves some real-life incidents into the story of Jacob Jankowski, a beloved only son who is well on his way to becoming a veterinarian.  Shortly before he is due to graduate, his parents are killed in a car accident and he is left penniless.  He accidentally climbs on a circus train and his fate is then sealed.  Despite the fact that he has not finished his veterinary training, he is taken on as a circus vet.  The story is told by Jacob when he is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and is waiting for his family to come and take him to the cicus.  The book is interesting and creative, and is a very good read.

This story is a great picture of how our memories affect our present.  Jacob's story from 70 years ago informs his present, and brings us along for the ride.  The writing is beautiful, and his memories are as real to us as they are to him.  The message of loyalty and love shine through, and the details ring true, because of the thorough research.  Read it before seeing the movie, which looks good too.

I am not quite sure how to rate this book.  It was a book club pick or I probably would not have read it.  I picked it up and put it down countless times before I could actually finish it.  I just could not get past the animal cruelty scenes.  Plus I am probably one of a minority of people that do not believe animals are here for our entertainment.  The fact that they were and still are, I am sure, in many third rate circuses/traveling zoos mistreated makes it all the more heartbreaking for me.  I had to give the book stars for the scenes involving Jacob in his old age and also for making you care about the characters.  I cried over Walter's fate.  The author also took pity on me and at least made me think some of the animals received a better fate and future.  I keeping thinking about Rex though...........

For the past few months, I seem to have only been reading thought provoking books.  Some were illuminating, some were disturbing, some made me think about some of my most deeply held beliefs.  All in all - I am very glad I read these books, but as I started into "Water for Elephants", I realized that it had been quite a while since I read a book mainly to find out what happens at the end.My dad recommended this book - and I'm glad he did.  It's a wonderful story.  We experience, along with the main character Jacob, two parts of his life.  We travel through the Great Depression with him after he runs away and joins the circus (!) and we also see his current life as a patient/resident of an assisted living center.  Both times of his life were interesting to me.  I know next to nothing about circuses - yet I could almost smell the sawdust and hear the music as I made my way through this tale.Gruen has filled her story with the colorful characters one would expect from a circus troupe.  Beautiful acrobats, tortured clowns, animals with personalities almost as big as their trainers (and sometimes bigger!).  The details are excellently woven in, letting the reader see just enough without blocking one's imagination.  As the story builds towards the climax - I found myself doubting the ending I had been sure would take place.  Gruen creates just enough tension and suspense to keep the reader turning the pages at a brisk pace.I enjoyed, too, the scenes of Jacob in the present day.  All circus aspects aside, the book has some excellent insight into a man who feels as if he has outlived his life...without becoming a man who was finished with living.  His fears of losing his memories and mind, the despair he feels at the sameness of each day, and the appreciation he has for the few delights left in his day to day existence are beautifully crafted.  He may come across as a crotchety old man at times, but the reader, and a few characters whose eyes still see a man instead of an old man, know that not to be true."Water for Elephants" was a very enjoyable story.  It was an interesting and fun book - well researched and well-written.  While I didn't take many notes while reading, it was not for lack of content, but because I didn't want to miss a minute of the story.

Ok, I guess I should start off by saying this review contains SPOILERS!  I always like to warn people just in case, but in this situation I really don't think it's necessary, becuase the very first chapter sort of ruins the polt anyways.  In the very first chapter we are given a flash back to all the actual drama of the book and we are told that in the middle of a stampede in the menagerie of a circus... rosie the elephant kills her trainer August.  This did grab my attention and get me into the book.  But as I went along, I realized,  I think they gave away all the good stuff in the first couple pages!  I would much rather have not known that this incident was going to happen so early on!  Because really, this is the major turning point of the book.  THE event the whole story is leading up to.  So, really, there are no real surprises here.However, with that being said, I must admit that the story is very beautifully written and does a great job of creating to amazing beautiful mental pictures as you go.  It will make a very visually appealing movie.  And I liked the scenes in the nursing home where we really get to know Jacob the main charater.  And I loved the bond created bewteen all the circus people and the animals throughout the story.  I just felt that since they told the ending right away, they took all the mystery and suspense out of the book.  :(And on a final note... the very very ending, was cute in some ways, but it was incredibly unbelieveable, and kinda silly.  I won't ruin this for you by spilling the beans, I'll let you get a little surprise with this ending part  ;)

I was practically forced to read this book by my partner, who loved it and would not stop insisting that I had to read it. I offered lots of excuses as I put it off, but the truth is, I couldn't care less about the circus. When I finally gave in and started reading Water for Elephants, I realized on the first page that my apathy for the circus didn't matter.This was a touching, clever, totally unexpected story. It offers a window into how we treat the elderly, animals, and people of a different class, without ever being preachy. There were times when I feared it would become a depressing wallow, but that never happened. The unexpected upswing at the end was particularly satisfying. A great read.

This book has it all...devastation, adventure, friendship, humor, romance, plus it's beautifully written with a wonderful ending to boot, what's not to love!Jacob is extremely naive and young in his life, from a nice home with loving parents and a successful career in plain sight; what he learns on the train is a real jolt into the life of a nomad and as a reader you get to experience his growth into a man.  One women in my book club felt it was a tad graphic and even though I agree to a point I felt it was necessary for us to see Jacob experience a world of unspoken truths.  The life on a circus train exposes him to situations that he definitely wouldn't have seen as a neighborhood vet, including, sex, alcoholism, prostitution, starvation, survival... This is written from Jacob's perspective, a boy who's been snatched from a life of predictable comforts and is thrown into a nomadic life aboard a, virtually life-threatening, train to nowhere; of course it's going to be a bit graphic and detail emphasized!This book really transports you into an era long past and I could feel and smell the circus.  It also makes you want to run to the nearest retirement home and volunteer.  The characters were very well developed and believable as were the animals.  I didn't turn the last page with any disappointment; the story was complete and satisfying, no open endings, no need for a sequel.  Excellent, one I will read again.  The movie didn't hold a candle to the book.

What a fun story, cleverly delivered as Jacob moves back in time to relive his story and returns to the present, his disgruntled present.  Some critics have complained about the ending, but I'd have to say they are Bah, humbug critics.  The ending is delightful, one of the best ever. This is a feel good story and it IS fiction, so the complainers, IMO, just don't understand Suspended disbelief.  The story is magical in its authentic setting and making you feel you are under the big top. It is sometimes shocking, sometimes painful, always compelling. Don't miss this one.  ...Karleene Morrow, author of Destinies, a novel.

While certainly Water for Elephants includes the harsh reality of what circus life was like during the depression, I found it more of a story of hope, love and survival. How desperation drives people to do tragic things to one another, yet just when you think all is lost, a surprising hero can save the day.As with any good story, the author must offer conflict and contrast, and as much as animal cruelty existed in the story, so did an intense love for animals that some of the characters had. In many ways this story was one of good vs. evil set in the unusual backdrop of the circus train.This is one of my new favorites.  I read it twice, about a year apart and I enjoyed it as much the second time.

I was surprised on how much I liked this book.  Once I started, I could not put it down.  Loved the story from the lead male characters perspective. The detail was so good, I could envision the Circus environment like I was there.  The story was both sad and funny and had several good supporting characters. I can definately see Reese Witherspoon in the movie as the female lead.  Great Reading!!

First, the good:1. This is a fast-paced, easy read. It's easy to become engrossed in the description of circus life during the Depression era. It kept me reading and kept me interested.However:1. There were so many characters that are suddenly mentioned, without any introduction. This happens especially when Jacob joins the circus. I almost gave up trying to sort out who all these people were and believe it or not, a lot of them weren't mentioned more than a few times. Still, it was jarring trying to figure out who was important and who wasn't.2. As soon as Jacob sees Marlena, the beautiful equestrian performer, we know that they are going to be romantically involved. But when their romance does take off, there's no real build up. I didn't find myself caring about their romance because it wasn't something they fought for: they just happened to fall into bed together one day. Woohoo.3. Jacob at 23 has these epiphanies once in awhile about how he loves and wants to protect the animals at the circus because his father would have wanted him to and blah blah blah. But he simply doesn't. I found it difficult to care about him when he doesn't do anything to protect the animals he claims to care for.Overall, I enjoyed this book. There were some things that could definitely have been improved upon, but overall, it was an interesting and intriguing world to be pulled into.

A man in a nursing home relives his younger years as a vet for a circus. To this reader, not a very compelling premise, yet once I read the first paragraph I was instantly hooked. By the second chapter, I had grown so attached to the main character that I truly felt for the things that happened to him. The story is told in rich, vivid prose, capturing each character so well that they soon became my friends and enemies, depending on the character. This book addresses a wide range of human experiences in a tasteful manner in which this reader was left in a pensive, awe-struck mood contemplating far more important questions and ideas about human existence. It also needs to be noted that this book is extremely well researched and bases its story around actual happenings in Circus history.

Thank god for a happy ending - the entire book depressed me - the human and animal cruelty, the redlightings, the drinking of Sterno (!?), the depiction of the folks in the "Assisted Living" facility (sounded more like a nursing home than ALs I know).  I read it in a day and a half just to get through it for book club, but I wouldn't have finished it otherwise....  and I finish virtually every book I start.

Great book, I like the way the story moved between the character as an old man and his younger days in the circus.  However, the formatting in this book is so screwy, I'd often have to reread sentences so I could work out what they were saying and that really pulled me out of the story.  There were multiple instances of missing spaces between words and paragraph breaks in the middle of a sentence.  Did the publisher even have someone proofread the ebook version?

This book was a quick read, and I thought it was very interesting. The reader gets a close up view of the inner workings of the circus, the performers, animal caretakers, etc, mixed in with a love story of sorts. However, even though the book was good, it was not great. It's not one I'd want to keep, or read again. The author introduced too many characters too quickly, and only after reading on for awhile do you sort them out. I didn't really come to love any of the characters enough to care much about what happened to them. The plot seemed weak, character development weak. I liked the HBO series Carnivale, and although this is also a circus book, it was slightly disappointing to me.

I don't read reviews before I read a book, I'll read anything I can get my hands on. When I got this book I flipped through it, and I didn't think I'd like it because of the pictures. But after the FIRST page I was hooked. I LOVED LOVED LOVED Jacob and Marlana...and HATED Uncle Al and August. I wanted to cry everytime Auggie went to the tent to lay it on Rosie. It made me sick. It's been a while since I read something so moving! A+++++++++

I bought this book because I ran out of things to read. I wandered around the store and noticed how much display this book was given to. I purchased it solely based on its popularity.I started reading it and had a bit of a hard time moving forward. English is not my native tongue and all the circus talk really made my head spin. I took a short break and finished an easy read and then resumed this book. I am glad I did.I felt very engaged after 1/3 of the book when most of the characters started to build and show their individual qualities. As the book went on, I felt I was also living in this circus train and witnessing all the activities.My heart definitely melted when they acquired Rosie, the elephant and at the same time, I started loathing the character August for abusing the elephant so much. In addition to that, the performer Walter/Kinko also transformed into this loving person that looked out after others.About half way through the book, I think almost all readers wanted nothing more than Jacob and Marlena being together and the death of August and Uncle Al. One thing I do believe a good author offers is the connection between the readers and the characters and I definitely felt that engagement with some of them and my heart ached at times as the story continued.I am not sure if I am a big fan of the Old Jacob. Not that it is bad but I really just did not quite get why it was important to keep his voice in. I did not see how old Jacob has contributed to the book and I think it could do without.Overall, I enjoyed the book so much and I was very happy to have resumed and finished it. It is a book that broadens your mind and showers you with all the circus knowledge. A fun and great read!

Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, 'Water For Elephants,' unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page.

I came into this book not expecting much at all, and ended up excessively loving it! This is one of those stories where you think you've figure out exactly how everything is going to go . . . And then nothing turns out the way you thought it would.Books that have a frame for the story like Water for Elephants had will, if done well, really get me to know and love the characters. Having Jacob's narration of the circus events interrupted by `present day Jacob' was a nice little detail. I definitely felt sad for the ninety-something year old, feeling nearly helpless and lonely. As he feels he's losing control of his life, his mind slips back to the past, and through these lapses we're told the story.I never knew anything about how circuses traveled about in the past, and hearing about the cutthroat America during the Great Depression certainly brought an overpowering feel of reality to the story. Jobs were few and far between, and those that had them did anything they could to keep them. Describing the desperate times, the hobo jungles, and the pay cuts served to present a great representation of the time period.I loved hearing about the different circus acts, though I know that was but a miniscule part of the story. The tiny facts and funniest little things kept my interest and had me smiling. This book is definitely dark and depressing at moments. At others, it is brilliantly bright and full of hope. Any novel that can pull off both sides of the spectrum nearly flawlessly is excellent in my book.I give Water for Elephants 5/5 stars. It was fantastic, and I'll definitely have to check out the upcoming movie now! I really recommend it. I have a feeling it is one of those books I will never forget.

This is truly a well written book. The author let's you clearly see a very frail old man, his present hospital-like surroundings including the nursing staff and other elderly people in this assisted living facility.The author is clever enough to break up the terrible animal and human cruelties and sadness of the early 1930's era, the circus itself and the indignities some humans endured by inserting enough humor and back flashes to keep the reader from getting very depressed.This is not a pretty story, but it certainly reminds me of the era, which I am old enough to remember, not from a circus life, but from the life of a very poor, homeless family.The author took me back to places I have not been in several decades. I can smell the circus animals, see the uppity "performers" as well as the horrible "tents", the freaks and the laborers who set up and take down the tents.  I can visualise from the words of Sara Gruen, the trains in which many circus people travelled. Oh, yes, believe it or not as a little child, but old enough to remember, this is a mode of travel I recall vividly.I have put Sara Gruen's other books on my Amazon wish list and if I don't receive them as gifts I will eventually buy them for myself.  Her written words come close to looking at old photograps in her novel "Water for Elephants".

Wow. I hope that's not all I can say about this book, but that's where I'll start. Wow.Every time I hesitate to think I'll find a book that is captivating, entertaining, and that will keep my interest and keep me thinking about its characters long after the book is over, I somehow seem to find myself happily surprised. Water for Elephants was one of those books. It was really that good.I heard good things about it, always saw it on the shelves at bookstores, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to give it a chance. Why? A book about a circus in the depression/prohibition era is probably as far away from my "normal" reading zone as I can get.  But I'm telling you - it doesn't matter! Not one bit.Entertaining and engrossing from the very first chapter, I was taken away on this journey with the characters. Nothing short of fascinating, in ways I wouldn't have thought possible.  Part love story, part coming of age, this is at its roots, a story about life and the unexpected paths it may take. I really came to love the character of Jacob, and sympathize with his situation and his love for animals. It's been over a week since I've finished the novel, and I still think about the characters every day.  I really got caught up in their world which is something, I must say, is sometimes way too rare in the books I read. Many are good stories, but with Water for Elephants, I really felt like I was traveling along with them in their adventures. A pleasant surprise.Overall, I have already recommended to more than a few friends, and would encouragingly recommend it here. It may just be one of those precious few books that when you finish it, you stop and, at a loss for words, say - wow.

Book has been extensively reviewed, with detailed plot descriptions, and also made into a movie.  It was an enjoyable read that captures the essence of the 30's beautifully.  The characters were compelling, and memorable, making their struggles something the reader gets on board for very quickly.  I do not wish to reveal any plot points, but I was left with a few unanswered questions with respect to the main character, and why his relationship with his children in his later years seemed so distant.

I had this book on my to read list for some time, when I saw that the movie was coming out soon I decided I better get to reading this.  I listened to this as an audio book and it was very well done; they have two readers one for Jacob in his twenties and one for Jacob in his nineties.  It was a good read and I enjoyed learning about the circus.Jacob is ninety three and living in a retirement home, through his dreams and daydreams he relives a tumultuous time in his life in his twenties.  When Jacob is in his twenties he is getting ready to sit for his Veterinarian finals at Cornell University when he gets a call; his parents have been killed in a car accident.  Then when he gets home he finds out that the bank has seized his parents' house.  In a fit of grief and sorrow he abandons his exams and hops a train that just happens to be part of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  Through a series of circumstances he ends up working for them as their vet; taking care of the exotic animals in their menagerie.  In the process of all of this he falls in love with a beautiful performer named Marlena who has a brutally viscous husband, who also happens to be Jacob's boss.There were a number of things I liked about this book.  The story moves quickly and has a sense of mystery and doom about it as Jacob falls deeper into the seedy goings on in the circus and deeper in love with Marlena.  It is very engaging.It is clever how you see into Jacob's life in the present while he is in a nursing home.  These portions of the story really tug at your heart and give insight into an old man struggling to retain his sense of self in an environment where everything is sanitized and ordered.  These glimpses are bittersweet in contrast to the crazy life Jacob lived; obviously this man has lived and lived well and it is heartbreaking to watch him struggle with the descent into age that we are all faced with.The majority of the story is about Jacob's life in the circus.  Gruen doesn't shy away from the nitty gritty including sex, violence, language; as such this is definitely an adult read.  Issues such as animal cruelty, squalid living conditions for workers, and the Depression are woven throughout.  Making the story very believable and easy to relate to.All of the characters in this book are very human and engaging and have a lot of depth. Even the villainous characters (Al and August) have moments of graciousness and goodness.  While the main "good" characters do things that border on bad, if only through neglect.The only thing that really bothered me with this book is that I thought Jacob made too many bad decisions and too many mistakes.  I understood that he was young and hot-headed, but at the same time he is supposed to be very smart...and well...let's just say he doesn't spend much time thinking about his actions.  A lot of what happened he brought on himself and I think that this was inconsistent with the way he was presented as an upstanding citizen and character.The book ends well and should leave readers happy and smiling.  The story is expertly told and the look into the way a circus runs fascinating.  It would have been nice to have an afterward of Gruen talking about how accurately she represented the circus in this book.  Were all circuses like this?  Or was this one particularly bad?Overall this was a very engaging story, I enjoyed it a lot, and am happy that I read it.  The characters are fascinating, the glimpses into both life in the circus and life in a nursing home intriguing as well.  I loved how the book was set up with us seeing the elder Jacob's memories/story through his eyes.  Definitely a book to check out if you are at all interested in circuses or people living during the Depression Era.

This is not a great book. It suffers from a predictable plot, cardboard characters and formaldehyde dialogue, and its success is obviously due to the imprimatur of the Oracle Oprah (and you will notice that nearly all the positive reviews here are from the distaff side), but it does have one salient virtue. It gets all the facts right.I become enraged, when reading a novel, if I notice that the author was too lazy to research (look up) what he's writing about. In detective stories such errors are usually about guns; in other novels inaccuracies are often about cars or planes. But Ms. Gruen, to her everlasting credit, has all the arcane details of the bygone circus life perfectly accurate. Because of this, I'm eager to forgive the book's other shortcomings.Now, obviously Sara Gruen did not work in a circus in the 1930s. She has never worked in a circus. She obviously learned all the arcane details of circus lore from reading other, better books. One such book isCircus Paradeby the hobo writer Jim Tully.Circus Paradeis ten times the book that this one is, and the original story of the elephant who got revenge on his mean trainer can be found in it.

This was a fantastic story.  Jacob Jankowski is a 93 year old man.  When the circus pays a visit to the lot across from the Nursing Home he lives in, it takes him back to when he was employed by a circus during the depression.  And so the book alternates between today and the 1930's.  This book grabbed me from the beginning.  Especially since Jacob attended school at Cornell and caught the circus train on it's way to Utica.  Places I am very familiar with.  The fact that he is Polish is another plus.  This story is put together very well.  Gruen obviously did her research and I finish this book with some knowledge about Jamaica ginger paralysis, exotic animal behavior and of course, the circus.  It is definitely going on my personal list of "classics" and "1001 books to read before you die".

I don't know how I've missed this one---it is such a powerful, emotional read.  Make sure you have your Kleenex handy because Water for Elephants is a tear-jerker.The story is told in the first person with Jacob as the narrator.  The story switches from Jacob in his nineties in the nursing home to Jacob in his twenties during his circus days.  Sometimes alternating perspectives can get choppy but Sara Gruen gets the pacing just right.Water for Elephants is about a traveling circus, but it is mostly a love story---or at least it was for me.  Fans of historical fiction, or readers just wanting an engrossing story will love this one.Just One Gripe:It can get a little graphic at times.The Best Thing About This Book:I loved the ending.

Part of me feels like this book had all the trappings of a steamy romance novel without all the sexy bits. It was certainly readable enough, but the love story between Jacob and Marlena was what kept the story going and for me, it just wasn't enough. I needed more feeling, more passion, more drama, and (if this was the angle the book was going to take) more sexy bits.Having recently readThe Night Circus, I like the angle of the dark side of the lives of traveling circus people, but it almost seemed like too much of a trope when Jacob ran away with the circus. Still, I suppose enough people must have done so back in the day for it to become a saying.I thought the book was good, but I was expecting something great given the book's popularity and I just don't feel like I found it with Water for Elephants. There is some good action and some romance but to me it felt like more of a romance novel without much sex than a contemporary literary classic. Even then, I love a happy ending and couldn't wait to read this one as I got closer and closer to the climax. Just could have used more climax...

Ok,I hate giving an even average review for books, but for this one I am going to say it was a little below average. The ending was not good. PERIOD. Even if we as the reader were sopposed to interpret it as beleivable; it wasn't. Also, if we were made to make up our own interpreation about the ending it still doesnt sit weil.Also, there is alot of catching up. The female lead character spills her story at the end, but it's too much information without a sense of who she really is. Overall, the book was just ok. If the ending stopped a few pages before the end it would have been better. I also felt that besides the obvious differences; the movie and the book were both a little below average. Usually, the book is either profoundly better or ridiculously worse than the movie. I read the book twice and saw the movie once, and I rate them as follows:The book 3 starsThe movie 1 star (because it costed way more money).I am glad everyone loved the book though! Maybe it's just me?

After the sudden death of his parents, veterinary student Jacob joins the circus, where he falls in love with the elephant Rosie and her rider Marlena. Both of his loves, though, are horrifically abused by August, the animal trainer. The setting of a circus during the Great Depression, and Gruen's obvious affection and knowledge of the period and setting, create an engaging book, but the plot and main characters leave much to be desired in terms of originality or interest. Though gritty and unflinching, particularly in its look at animal cruelty, the book's potential is wasted, sadly. Turns out to be pretty meh. Grade: C+

I was curious.  I knew there was a movie based on the book.  I had never seen that movie as I thought it looked cheesy.  So I took a chance on the book and was not disappointed!What a view into the circus culture!  Things the customers don't see and would never expect!  I've been dying to see the movie since and can't find it in Redbox and none of my friends own it.  And it's not On Demand!  I will see it at some point though.  I think now it will be worth it.

I had the opportunity to meet Sara Gruen recently. She came to Fort Collins because her German Shephard needed open heart surgery, and while she was in town, she held a discussion/book signing at a local bookstore. Something she said struck me as rather odd. She said that she wanted the old circus photographs included in her novel because she didn't feel her readers would believe what she had written without the pictures. I'm not sure why she would feel this way, because as many reviewers have noted, her descriptions of the circus where the strongest parts of this novel.This was a book that I wanted to like better, but after all was said and done, it didn't leave much of an impression, other than her extensive research. The story, particularly the love story, was cliched, and the entire plot is predictable. Additionally, some parts of the story don't seem plausible. *SPOILER* For example, why would Jacob walk away from an Ivy League degree, needing only to complete a final exam? Yes, his parents were killed, but he knows that they made great sacrifices for him to attend Cornell. And what are the odds that when he jumps onto a passing train in the middle of the night, it just happens to be a circus train?In addition to the predictable plot, it was hard to relate to any of thecliched characters. I think it says a lot when the most interesting character in the book is Rosie the elephant. Jacob displays little or no character growth. And the book has a typical "Hollywood" ending where the good guys get everything they want, even though they've had to sacrifice virtually nothing. And some of the dialogue in this book reads like a romance novel.That said, there are flashes of quality in this novel. The sections that take place inside the nursing home are well done, and in fact, old Jacob is a more interesting character than young Jacob.I just wish that the author had taken as much care in plotting her book and developing her characters as she did in doing her research.

Water for Elephants is a very fine book, well worth the read, for many reasons:1.  The book wonderfully captures place and time.  Set in the depression, it authentically  captures the spirit and feel of the era, including its description of the economics of the time, hobo life, the depression, etc.2.  It vibrantly and realistically describes life in the travelling circuses of the era, including the freaks and other performers, the pecking order between management, performers and workers, life on the train, stops for shows in the small communities, and vivid descriptions of the performances.3.  The characters have depth and breadth, and touch you with their humanity (which is sometimes kind and more often than not, evil--as humans can be).4.  The novel very effectively contrasts the protagonist's current situation in a nursing home with his recollections of the bulk of the novel's depression-era actions.5.  Without giving too much away, the novel very satisfyingly (if perhaps a bit unrealistically) concludes with a feel good ending--and who can resist a happy ending.In conclusion, this book is a decently written, plot driven, page turner, which tells a touching tale, set against a colorful background of time and place, populated by characters which are larger than life (yet realistic in thought and deed).  While the writing perhaps does not qualify it as "great literature," its easily the best of the ten or so books I have read over the past six months.Ken

This book flashed between Jacob as an old man and Jacob as a young man just after his parents' death.  Despite his being utterly destroyed by his parents' death, he never really mentioned it again after he joined the circus.  That seemed odd to me.  And the roughness with which he was greeted when he joined would make most ivy league softies run for the hills, so that was odd, too.  I could never understand how he was finding comfort from his parents' death by being treated like crap and working like a dog with barely any water to drink or shower.I enjoyed the elderly Jacob much more, and was charmed by the ending.  I did not enjoy the lengthy descriptions of rolling up circus tents and beating of animals.  I know it happened, but it made me feel ill.  And the sexual descriptions?  I don't like them.  I'm not a prude and I certainly enjoy sex and all its wonders, but I'm sick of reading about it in every single book I touch.  Just once, can't we just leave the details of that out and let a tale stand on its own?I guess the ending made the book worthwhile, but I wouldn't recommend it as much as others have recommended it to me.

One sign of a skilled novelist is the ability to write convincingly from the point of view of characters who share little in common with the author.  (I would liken this skill to that of a masterful actor capable of playing a wide range of movie roles.)In "Water For Elephants" Sara Gruen showcases this rare talent, telling a Depression-era circus tale from the perspective of a veterinarian named Jacob Jankowski (both in his twenties and flashing back from his nineties) in a convincing and captivating manner.  The contrast between the innocent young Jacob's foray into the rough-and-tumble world of a traveling circus and the old Jacob's cynical ruminations on life in a nursing home creates a "book end" effect that makes his story feel more real and meaningful.Gruen has also infused her novel with enough historical details to bring the sights, sounds and smells of the midway, menagerie and big top to life, without cramming in superfluous details that could have dragged on the story line.  The dialogue is sublime, especially the banter between the working men who handle the behind-the-scenes grunt work.  Her characterization is strong as well: I was moved by the star-crossed romance between Jacob and Marlena, repulsed by the evil of August and Uncle Al, and captivated by the antics of Rosie the elephant.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience, most deserving of its long run on the best-seller list.

I purchased this as an audiobook.  My husband and I listened to it on our trip down to and back from Iowa over Christmas. This was his first audiobook ever.  (Actually, his first book for pleasure since he was in high school.) This was a fantastic story! We found ourselves discussing the characters and storyline as if they were real when we would stop for lunch, etc.  I typically sleep for most of the drive (thankfully I am the passenger) but this book kept me awake the entire drive.The storyline starts out with main character as an old man. Then switches to him as a young man and how he ends up working with a circus that travels by train from location to location.  The characters are introduced beautifully. Each character has a distinct voice in the audiobook. Even though the story moves from present time and back to the past throughout the story, there is no confusion as to what "time" the story is in.  We are still talking about this book every so often.Kimberly

"Water for Elephants" is wonderful Depression-era circus history retold with a compelling story line. I was fascinated by this carefully researched, well-written look at the circus as a community with its own cultural norms, traditions, pecking order, and social bonds.A little-bit love story, a little-bit adventure,the underlying message is that individuals can overcome adversity if they are brave enough, or desperate enough, to take their lives into their own hands.This is the story of Jacob Jankowski, a Cornell vet student who loses everything in the Great Depression; parents, home, incipient career. Almost by accident he becomes a circus veterinarian. After a long and successful life, the elderly Jankowski escapes from a nursing home to once again join the Big Top.The author agiley shifts between Jacob's memories of circus life and his life in the nursing home. As Jacob's memories and present-day realities merge, the line between truth and fiction blurs. Perhaps Mr. Jankowski really did toddle off in his walker to be reabsorbed into the circus world; perhaps he died dreaming in his wheelchair.This is a lovely book; well-worth reading if you are interested in early twentieth-century history and/or the aging process.Kim BurdickStanton, Delaware

OK... this is the classic, "don't read a book by its cover".The title of this book and the cover picture caused me to leave it sitting on my bookshelf for almost a year (it was a gift). I finally picked it up because I had nothing left to read... and I really, really enjoyed it!93 year old Jacob is the narrator and he flashes back and forth from his current life, in a nursing home, to his past life as a member of a traveling circus during his early twenty's.There are two stories going on here: the story of his youth, which is a fascinating one, and the more subtle story of the passage of time and the process of aging on the human body, psyche, and relations.The stories of Jacob's youth as a circus "veterinarian" and his relationships with the other performers were not only interesting as stories, but historically educational and informational. It is all about life in the Circuses of the 1930's, the great depression, and prohibition. However, it is the secondary, more subtle, story of the aging process that I find haunting me still.

I've decided I just can't finish this book. The main character is a 23-year old male, but c'mon - I just don't appreciate some of the details the author is having him describe and they are totally unnecessary to the story. I've read almost nine chapters and decided I don't need any more images like the explicit strip scene, the details of a graphic "8-pager", and I certainly didn't need the picture of what the dwarf is doing alone on his cot while looking at the graphic magazine. It's a big disappointment because the story is actually interesting and I want to find out what happens but not badly enough to wade through the sludge. I don't think I've been this disappointed in a story since the ending of Angela's Ashes.

This book is written in two narratives: the past and the present. It is written with such elegance and grace, that each voice is like a piece of silk weaving in and out like a slice of humanity screaming to be heard.Jacob Jankouwski tells this unbelievable tale from a rest home at ninety or is it 93? And his memories are so lush and tragic that the reader will be transformed into his past along with him.Jacob enters the `circus life' by no desire of his own, but this world changes him beyond belief.  The reader will be changed, too, and utterly awakened by this world within a world.  The caste system at The Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth reminded me of working on the cruise ships----the engineers, waiters, and third country employees working below the ship (boiler room) and the showgirls, casino staff, and shop girls working and living above the ship--as if they were superior in some respect.Rosie, the elephant, becomes the voice for all animals, whom deserve respect and caring for.  She also becomes the voice for old folks, such as Jacob, who for some reason are tossed to the side because of old bones, old minds, and loss of memory.Oh, but Rosie has not lost her memory as the reader will see.  And the abusers will pay for their sins as we all do.Sara Gruen has created brilliant, memorable characters, people whom I fell in love with and cared deeply about.  For example, Walter, the dwarf, who was so hard and incredulous on the outside, but had a dog he adored like his own baby.  The characters are articulately developed, and one will even feel empathy for the hateful August."Water for Elephants" is a book about humanity:  how it can be dark and light at the same time, how people can change, how others do not, how survival is connected to love, and above all, how giving water to elephants is like giving water to the world.I dreaded turning the last page, exiting the circus and all of its peculiarities and delights.  This book will leave the reader thirsty for more and more and more.*** A must read for fiction freaks!

I read this book from cover to cover, and I'm glad I did.  But I thought it was very sad, because of the old man in the nursing home narrating the book, because of the animal abuse to the elephant and other species, and because of the spousal abuse to the elephant rider.  Oh, there were elements of humor, friendship, love, and happiness.  The ending was good as well as unexpected.  Still, if I had to describe this book in just one word, it would be "sad."

This is one of those reads that, when you are done, you cannot get out of your mind!  I have loaned my book out many times, always insisting I get it back.  The characters are endearing, and the story line is great!  I can't wait to see if this becomes a movie!  Whenever I have someone ask for recommendations for good reads, this is at the top of my list.

We are all going to be old one day and remember the times of our youth. This book takes you back to the time of a young man as he slaved his way for a traveling circus. It is all about trials, hardships, and love prevailing, of course. I could not stop reading this book and in the end could only imagine myself as the character wanting for a last taste of my youth.

This was an excellent story! Puts truth to the phrase, you never know where life will take you! I definitely want to visit the Ringling museum in Sarasota, fl. This book gives an insight to the circus that I never would have imagined. Great Story!

Have you ever experienced an unexpected disaster, something that leaves you completely alone? Water for Elephants tells the story of life after tragedy, when Jacob Jankowski is accidentally thrust into a chaotic circus whirlwind. He discovers the truth about life on a circus for both the performers and workers but more importantly the circus animals. A veterinary major at Cornell university drop out, Jacob needed a break from the world that had plummeted toward him at a thousand miles an hour. Leaving him with not a cent, not a family member, and no certain future.This 5 star book opened the eyes of many across the world to the condition of a circus life in the early 1900's, and how this life could go spinning out of control at any given moment. Each page rich with love, hate, and jealousy, Sara Gruen creates a masterpiece of twists and turns aboard the `Flying Squadron' with the `Benzini Brothers most Spectacular Show on Earth'. This book shows the greed and hunger for money and wealth and the harsh conditions of the Great Depression from front to back. Her writing leaves you hanging on every word, and her distinct characters introduced throughout the story never expose their comfortable selves among the dishonest businesses of the circus. Definitely a 5 star novel, I recommend this book to both teenagers and adults as a MUST read book, Water for Elephants truly makes a difference.-kd

I know there are hundreds of reviews for this book, but I liked it so much, I just had to add mine. I usually read a book before seeing the movie. I fing that the book is generally better than the movie. This book was amazing. I felt like I was living in a real circus. I am also a nurse, so can identify with the main character in a nursing home. Nursing home people are so very lonely. anyway, this is a real story, like the ones you were told when you were young. It took me back and made me feel like I was truely there. You have to read it. Maybe I'll see the movie now.barbara

This is a wonderful story. I never thought I would enjoy a novel about life in a circus so when my friend recommended this book I was very sceptical. Even the title seemed a little strange. However I loved every page.  Go on. Read it. It's great.

Sara Gruen's gorgeous new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, unfolds as a dual narrative, alternating between Jacob Jankowski's life as a nonagenarian, and his time spent working for a ragtag Depression-era circus as a young man. The plot is captivating (I missed two meals because I didn't want to put the book down) and Gruen's writing, as always, is transcendent. She deftly evokes a fascinating period in American history that deserves to be revisited, and her characters--human and animal alike--will stay with you long after you turn the last page.

Despite haunting cover art and a great title, despite obvious research and well thought out prose, and despite the fact that this book is the darling of the Independent Booksellers Association, I felt let down.  Part of the problem was that I expected a lot and had held this book on my shelf, until I could really savor it.  It does start out strong, and Gruen keeps her time periods well separated.  But the characters, especially the narrator, feel stock and unfinished and merely devices on which to hang the proceeds of research.  Because of the plusses of the book enumerated in the opening sentence of my review, I give 3 stars, but for the back story, it would be fewer.

I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of this book. "A book about a circus? How good could that really be?" I thought. It took awhile for me to get into it too. It wasn't that the beginning was boring or anything, it just took me a little while to get into the plot of the story. After I did though, I couldn't put it down. I lost sleep over the need to finish this book. Some parts I found surprisingly funny. It was an overall, all around good book.

What a terrific read!  It personally took me a few chapters to get into the book, seemed slow in parts but the story line made up for it.  My sisters ranted and raved about this book when it first hit the scene in 2006 I believe and I just read it-- and it was worth the read.  The depth and substance of the book was what kept me interested and invested in the characters.*Taken from another reviewer because it's said so well and I believe the same thing of the book: "Water for Elephants is a great book for a summer read.  It's obvious that the author did her research into the time period (post-Depression America), and the subject matter (traveling circuses).  According to the author's note at the end of the book, many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events, culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers.  As a result, Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative."

I'd been hearing a lot of rave reviews of this book in the writer's groups that I'm in (ALL rave reviews, as a matter of fact) and when I heard that the movie was due out soon, I purchased the e-book now so that I could compare the book to the movie. There are so many great things about this book, when you put it all together, it was just one of the best books I've ever read.The point of view for Water for Elephants is unique. Jacob, the main character, comes to us first as a 90 (or is it 93?) year old man who is living in a seniors home. Most of the story is Jacob recalling his life with the circus, with short trips back to his here-and-now. I felt that I came to know all of Jacob. From his beginning, losing his parents in an accident, to his experience with the circus and his true love, to his last days feeling trapped in a body and mind that he wasn't free to control himself any longer.With the story being set in the 1930's and in the Depression, the book was even more interesting to read about days in that era. At the end of the book, the author describes all of her research that she's done for her book. It's obvious by how thoroughly and well written Water for Elephants is.I highly, HIGHLY recommend this book!!!

Water For Elephants was just what I wanted in a book right now: an easy read, fun, romantic, with a unique setting. Sara Gruen's research into the life of long forgotten train circuses and America in the 1930s was obviously extensive and the way she used her knowledge in the writing of the book was loving and playful and made me want to learn more about it. There were a few things that I looked up, curious to know if they were the author's invention or actual historical facts that she incorporated into her story. For example, I had never heard of "Jake Leg" before and commend her for revealing in the context of her book parts of American history that most people must be unfamiliar with. The characters were well drawn and the fictional Circus she created was completely believable. I loved the photographs that accompanied each chapter which added to the believablity of her story. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to immerse themselves in a good old fashioned yarn filled with romance and even a little danger.

There were many good qualities in "Water for Elephants".It starts off with a very action-packed prologue.Then, suddenly you're witnessing a confused, aging old man who is being shuffled around in a nursing home- losing his memory and therefore also his mind."Water for Elephants" then switches between the old man, Jacob's, life versus the younger version of Jacob when he was in his early twenties- during probably the most important period of his life, ever.Then you are brought back to the action-packed prologue (except this time when reading it, you get the back story leading up to the event).In his 20s, Jacob was a vet for traveling circus for three months.  Obviously traveling with the circus is going to make for some really interesting stories.There are many details throughout the book that I didn't think were nearly as bad as others have made them out to be in these other reviews on Amazon.-The sexual content really wasn't that explicit.  There were maybe two sex scenes and they really weren't that bad.  If you want explicit sex in the middle of a fiction story (without being considered erotic fiction) read John Irving's "The World According to Garp" and/or "A Prayer for Owen Meany" and/or "The Fourth Hand" and/or "The 158-Pound Marriage".  All very good books that have way more detailed sex scenes that may or may not make you squeamish.  "Water for Elephants" barely grazed the surface of reproductive organs and whatnot.  So, if you're worried about that, don't be.-The animal cruelty also was not that bad.  Yes, it is written that someone would walk off and you could hear the animal cry out, but... other than that- it wasn't detracting from the entire story.  And not only that, but, I'm sure things like that really happen on the road.  There are definitely people who are capable of doing such things.  If you watch any show on "Animal Planet" or watch any real animal documentaries on late night television, you'll see that things are much worse.  So, if you're leery of the cruelty content, don't be.  It is also grazed over.There are many real elements- as far as I can tell- and whether or not the research was done before writing the novel, I think the descriptions are pretty believable.The only characters that really stood out were Walter and (in the beginning) Camel.  Jacob was a very strong narrator, but I didn't care for his burst of love for Marlena (a married performer).The back story behind Marlena and August's marriage was important, but it was summed up in about two paragraphs.The story behind Uncle Al's creation of the circus was interesting, but we barely meet Uncle Al.  And both August and Uncle Al seem to be bi-polar, which was annoying and unnecessary.  It is okay for there to be "normal" performers.  I don't think it was needed to move the story along or to qualify their actions.Most of the characters are added as bodies, but none have interesting or "deep" back stories.  To make it easier to remember their names and who they are (as the names are mentioned often), it would have been better for me to know more about these guys so that they really stick out in my mind as real people.There was nothing memorable about Camel by the end either- he lost his appeal about halfway through the book.Walter was interesting and probably my favorite character.Marlena was a bother.  I didn't get the whole tragedy of her marriage to August and felt that his temper was added in as only an excuse to make her want to be with Jacob.  The tangled love story wasn't even as interesting (to me) as the whole circus thing:  Redlighting and setting up the stage, and canceled wages, and the whole life of a circus performer.By the middle of the book, people started to become "missing" and/or dead, but I didn't care about those characters anyway- so, it seemed like those events were added just to make "Water for Elephants" interesting as a whole.This is my first Sara Gruen book, but it felt like "Water for Elephants" was a first novel for her too- though it was written well, the plot kind of fell flat by the middle of the story.  It was entertaining enough to finish, but I probably won't be recommending it.  I may try her again, in the future, but... I won't be jumping to it.

I loved this story line but because of the few sexual instance, I will not recommend to my friends or my teenage children. It was not necessary to be explicit to be effective. I loved the elderly community and how the novel flashbacks between present day and depression era.  I have grandparents this age and it was true to life in many ways.

Loved it! Absolutely loved it! The story was sweet, complicated and funny at times and it didn't leave me hanging. The story was completed and I love that! So many books leave you without finishing what was started and I liked that this one didn't. You find out exactly where the characters end up. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I could've done without the nursing home flashbacks, and I felt that the elderly Jacob's personality didn't match the younger Jacob's personality. At times i wished the whole book was set in the circus days, but then I feel like the reader wouldn't have gotten the sense of closer that comes with knowing where the character ends up in life.Overall, a wonderful story! I highly recommend it, and hope the movie doesn't ruin it.

Ninety-year old Jacob lives in a nursing home where he spends most days parked in the hallway, waiting for Sundays when a visitor comes.  He's excited because a traveling circus has set up next door and he can't wait to go.  He flashes back to his youth during the Depression, when he was penniless and joined a third-rate circus as an almost-qualified vet.  There, he fell in love with Marlena, the beautiful star horsewoman.  Unfortunately, his boss was her brutish husband.I absolutely loved this book.  It contrasts the misery of being old and helpless with the non-stop action of life "on the show," though that certainly had its share of misery, too.  The pathetic circus Jacob joined was full of lively characters, some kindly, others cruel, and Jacob was forced to grow from naive youth to courageous man.  There were many pages that reduced me to sobs, especially those detailing the agonizing despair of some nursing home residents and some instances of animal cruelty at the circus.I would have given this book five stars, but I didn't like that it was written in the first person (which immediately takes away some suspense as to the future of the narrator), and it was written entirely in the present tense which struck me as awkward.  The story itself is engaging, exciting, touching, and rewarding.  Highly recommended.

Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down! Grabs you from the first page, and doesn't let go! A fast-moving read with lots of action, and no filler. It has love, romance, mystery, murder, animals and history. All while riding a circus train during the depression in 1931. Cutting deftly back and forth from the eyes of an elderly man residing in a nursing home, to the days he spent traveling with the train circuses in the 1930's, this story is gritty, realistic, fascinating and highly entertaining. You won't be disappointed.

This took me to a different time and place than I've known before.  I felt like I was there.  The stress of the hard work, living conditions, lack of money and food, social hierachy, hidden relationships, and an ill schizophrenic fueled a desire for resolution.  That's what good books do.

Water for Elephants should not be missed! It is a beautifully written story with a lot of heart and soul.  The prologue will completely captivate you and you will be hooked from page one!The story begins with a 90 year old, who also could be 93, he doesn't actually remember how old he is, named Jacob Jankowski. Jacob is your typical old man. He's seen too much in his life to give a crap what people say and think. From the first line Jacob spoke, I knew I loved him. He was sarcastic and funny, but also sad and lonely. His wife died a few years before, and his children and grandchildren only visit him in the nursing home for a few hours on Sunday. All Jacob has left are his memories of working for a circus when he was 23 years old (Rob Pattinson played young Jacob in the movie and it was wonderful having to picture him as Jacob. It was a beautiful sight!).At 23, Jacob is about to graduate veterinary school and go on to work for his father caring for animals. When his parents die in a car accident, he learns that his parents left him with no money and the bank repossessed their home (it takes place during the depression, and the Jankowski's were struggling along with everyone else). Jacob, having no where to turn, jumps unto a moving train and in this moment his life will change forever.Water for Elephants has an amazing cast of characters that all bring something to the story. Jacob meets the beautiful, Marlena, her charming, but sadistic husband, August, as well as many others that all shape Jacob's life one way or another. Even the animals play a huge role in his life!I think my favorite part of this story was the last few pages. Not because it was over, but everything came together so beautifully. We last see Jacob as his 90 or 93 year old self, and you will not be disappointed on how his life will turn out.Water for Elephants is a must read! I just hope the movie will do this amazing book justice!

I've noticed that some have said they wanted to like this book due to the high praise others here have given it. I will try not to gush. But honestly, this is one of THE best books I have EVER read.From the beginning to the magnificent and most satisfying end, I was entirely delighted. Not every page was perfection I will admit but my annoyance was due to my own impatience about wanting to get back to a certain character rather than learning a bit more about another.It is quite clear from the moment you begin that the author did some seriously extensive research about the Depression era in general and circus life specifically.The way the author weaves the story between present day and older Jacob (at 90 or 93, he can't quite remember) and the flashbacks to the past (when Jacob was in his 20's) are fantastic. She handles aging and its inherent frustrations quite well, and Jacob is funny, endearing, and intensely likable.I enjoyed this novel so much, I immediately took it to my parent's and insisted they read it. Usually they stick to Nelson DeMille and Janet Evanovich novels (whom I also enjoy) so I knew this would be a little outside their comfort zone, but they humored me and read it. They both loved it! My father was as impressed as I at the ending, the satisfaction of it.They both commented that some of the nursing home scenes were depressing; Jacob discussing his failing memory or lack of motor skills. But I say again, the ending completely makes up for anything depressing in the home, at least for my family!Truly an amazing novel and I daresay, should be on the list of best books for the 21st century.  I read this book straight through, without stopping to sleep.Just an FYI, I actually HATE circuses. I find them tedious and beyond boring. NOT my sort of thing at all. Ugh. This book transcends all that.

In recent years, publishers have put out a number of collections of early twentieth century circus photographs.  The photographs are intensely interesting, revealing the grime, brutality and absurdity underneath the surface glamour of the traveling circuses of that era.Gruen was inspired by the photographs to write this novel.  Gruen thoroughly researched her subject matter, collecting scores of anecdotes that revealed the brutality and desperation of that world.  She weaved the anecdotes together with a love story worthy of a three-hanky weepie from the 1930s. The combination of grit and sweetness works only to a point, but the inherently interesting nature of the subject matter managed to hold my interest to the end.To me, however, Gruen never managed to transcend her source material.  The primary problem was the narrator's voice.  Although the book was sprinkled with circus-specific vocabularly of that era, Gruen utterly fails to capture the rhythm or syntax of the time or milieu. Gruen's language felt inappropriately contemporary, which undermined the overall credibility of the story.  The subject matter cried out for a writer with an ear for the street; I kept thinking about what Damon Runyon or Ring Lardner could have done with this material.The other major problem was that Gruen over-anthropomophized and over-romanticized the animals in the story.  Gruen could have honored the animals' intelligence -- and decried the brutality of their treatment -- without veering into fantasy.In the end, while I wasn't sorry I read the book, I would have preferred to read a non-fiction account of life in the Depression-era circus from a first hand source rather than this watered down trifle.

This book was enchanting.  Immediately you become under it's spell from the first words. The mystery, history, action, and love stories of the circus all wrapped up in one.The story is about Jacob Jankowski, the circus vet.  Under tragic circumstances, he joins a second rated circus and becomes entangled into all their lives, whether he wants to or not.  Bouncing between his current status, which is in a nursing home at the age of 93 or 99 (he's not sure) and his circus life, there is a mystery deep in the heart of it.

I actually wanted to give this book a 4.5 because it was more than your average "I like it" 4, but not quite the brain-exploding-spectacular 5. It was close, though. When I started reading, I wasn't sure if I'd like it; the story started slowly and felt disjointed at times. By the time I was about half-way through, however, I was flying through the pages, sneaking off to read every moment I could spare. I even read in the middle of the work day! Crazy. But it was that good. The circus culture of the early 1900s always intrigues me, particularly where it relates to animals. Gruen treated the topic with affection and accuracy, both of which she deftly imparts to the reader. I love Rosie the Elephant. A word to the wise: this novel was fairly gritty both for violence and sex, so not for YA readers.

I found this book while perusing Amazon.com.  It is rare for me to find a book that is so entertaining but this one was.  I have never read any of the other books by this author, but she is excellent.  The book takes you into the time of the depression and you feel, smell and experience everything that the charachter is feeling.  The main charachter is in his nineties now, but we get to travel back in time through him, to this time in U.S. history and experience how a traveling circus worked back then.  It is such a richly written story, you will not want to put it down.  The desperation of the times, the way people lived, their expectations, their feelings, etc. are all here.  I have recommended this book to multiple friends, which I rarely do.  You will not be disappointed with this story.  There are no low points that drag.  It's a green light read from start to finish.  There is an authors note at the end, and she explains how she came up with the idea and her research to write this book depicting this time period and the circus era.  Although it is fiction, she got the facts first and melded it into this novel.  Very good indeed.

Water for Elephants has all the makings for an entertaining read: tragedy, humor, romance, affairs.  I put this aside for awhile, trying to avoid all of the hype this book has received, but I am definitely glad I finally picked it up.Told from the point of view of his 93-year old self as he relives his life through his dreams, Jacob, a then-student about to finish gain his veterinary degree at the prestigious ivy league, Cornell, is abruptly summoned home to identify the bodies of his parents, who have tragically died in a car accident.  Left with no money, no practice, and no home, he starts to walk, unsure of where his once bright future now lies.  He stumbles upon the train of the Benzini Brothers circus.  The show's ringmaster, Uncle Al, whose ultimate goal is to "one-up" the more prominent Ringling circus, takes Jacob on as a vet to the animals in the show (because of course, if Ringling has a vet, he needs one too).Life on a circus train, however isn't all it's cracked up to be, and the circus and country has fallen on hard times & the working men find that more and more of their co-workers have been redlighted (tossed off the train in the dead of night) in order to cut costs.  With being redlighted as a real possibility, workers have to do their part to earn their place on the train and work hard not to make the wrong people angry, often without pay.As Jacob adjusts to life as part of a circus, he finds foes, friends who become family, and of course the love interests of the married star of the show! A tangled mess of jealous, mental illnesses, and the struggle to simply survive unfolds as the memories of his life come back to the 93-year old man in the nursing home.Definitely one of the best books I've read of all time, with 100% ability to become one of the classics that children will one day read in their English classes.  If you're looking for a book to transport you back in time, with the excitement that life on a circus trail brings, this is definitely a book for you to pick up.

I loved this book.  I could not put it down, because I was in such suspense about what would happen next.  I particularly love the storyline of the character as an old man in a nursing home - having worked in nursing homes, the descriptions are spot on.  I laughed out loud at his antics, and cried when characters I had grown to love were lost to tragedy.  I have never read a book where an elephant is a main character and pivotal to the story.  All I can say is "WOW."

I could not finish this book. It might have been interesting were it not for the terrible language, the graphic and totally disgusting sex scenes, and the cruelty to animals... ugh! I hated it!!! I still have the scene of the masturbating dwarf etched in my mind, and I read the book over a year ago!

I was excited to read this book because so many people loved it. I wanted to love it, I really did, but something just fell flat. The story was good, although I found the flashing back and forth distracting, and Sara Gruen obviously did copious amounts of research, but I just couldn't get excited about it.The character of Marlena could have been a really interesting and multi-layered person, but instead she is really only presented as a delicate flower who loves animals, married a psychopath, and sometimes displays teenage acts of defiance. Why did Jacob love her so much? There must have been more to her than that, but the reader is never let in on that secret. It's even more odd because the author is a woman. They had strong female personalities in the 1930s, I'm sure of it.As for Jacob, I thought that he displayed a lot of the conflict and inner questioning that you like to see in a lead character and his development as he gets to know the people that work for the circus was enjoyable. His relationship with the animals was obviously meant to heal him after the death of his parents, but again, I felt like that connection was rushed and then brushed aside. His relationship with Rosie, the gentle and abused Polish speaking (well, Polish understanding) elephant, was an excellent metaphor for his own gentle nature and his inability to stand up for himself and break free. Of course, in the end, everyone is free thanks to Rosie and we get the happy ending.I did not hate the book at all, but I wanted more from it. I think if the author had been allowed to write about 100 pages more, it could have been a great novel instead of just ok. The descriptions of the 1930s era circus and the care she took in researching every detail made the book very interesting. It's certainly worth a read.

Given all of the five-star reviews and the hype surrounding this book, I simply had to review.The good:  The overall setting and tone of the book were spot on. I really felt the genuine desperation of the Prohibition and the Depression.  The 1920s/30s traveling circus was interesting and well-researched.  Also the passages in which Jacob is 90 or 93 years old were beautifully written and very believable.The not-so-good:  The author often devoted long passages to the mundane and then just jumped over the parts of the story that a reader wants to spend time on (such as key dialogue between the main characters which would provide the reader with their back stories and develop a genuine love story)...which brings me to:The bad:  the characters are, for the most part, one-dimensional and the character dynamics and relationships are unrealized and unbelievable.  At its core, this is a romance and yet I never understood how and why the two characters fell in love.  They meet and next thing I know, they are in love.

I saw this book in the bookstore and it sounded very interesting so I got it out of the library. I wasn't disappointed. It was very easy to read and flowed nicely. Very interesting and quirky characters which I liked. Rosie the elephant was a great character. I agree with one of the other reviewers who compared the book to Sophies Choice. I thought the same thing when we meet the ringmaster. I really enjoyed the book but I was disappointed that there were a couple of parts that were unnecessarily crude (as opposed to necessarily crude?). It's like the female writer of the book had to prove that she could be as crude as any man. Other than that, it was one of my favourite books this year.

I listened to Water for Elephants as an audiobook.  The portrayal of old man Jacob by John Randolph Jones was spot on.  The enactment of the young Jacob by David LeDoux was good, but a little bit monotonous in tone.  He did do a good job on the other characters' voices, making them sound different from Jacob.  The book was well-written, with excellent characters who all had distinct personalities, and dialogue that rang true.  I bought the depression era plight of a young veterinary student doubly shocked at losing his parents and then their home.  This made a credible segue to his becoming the veterinarian for the Benzini Brothers circus.  Ms. Gruen does a believable portrayal of the Depression era, the working class, and the animals in the menagerie.  The story flows well, but is a bit melodramatic to my taste, in spots.  The love story between Jacob and Marlena works, but is a little long in development.  At first I did not see the relevance of the old Jacob interludes in the story, but they did lead to a sweet and appropriate ending to the book.I have one issue which maybe someone could answer.  I don't understand the relationship of the prologue to the rest of the book.  The text of the prologue duplicates the climactic event of the book itself, yet has a completely different outcome, and one that contradicts what happened "in real life".  I don't understand why there should be such a contradiction, and it wasn't explained by something like "and then I woke up from the dream".  Instead, the prologue merely ends with "in 70 years I never told a single soul" or something like this.  So why do we have a difference of fact between two parts of the book?  It is jarring and strange.  I also note that in the movie, the character, Uncle Al, was deleted when the screenplay was written.

I was compelled to finish the book and found the circus hx interesting.The story itself felt very Nicholas Sparks-like.So if you like his work, I think you'd like this book. The protagonist character didn't seem real...he was too good, too kind, too selfless. There were no real surprises about how the plot would unfold. But I'm glad I read it and it was a good escape.

This was a book that I truly did not think I'd like. Not a big fan of circuses, I just didn't think it would interest me. Boy, was I ever wrong! This book thrust me into its story from the very first page, and left me wanting more. The ending is wonderful - perfect and satisfying. While I am very leary of any book that contains abuse to animals, I found that I could endure the occasional abuses described somehow. I was so completely enthralled by the characters of this book, and could see the whole story in my mind's eye as I read. The author does say in an interview that the elephant, Rosie, was based on a real elephant (two, actually) she discovered when doing the research for this book. I often felt like I needed a shower while reading the book because it is so atmospheric and real that I felt like I'd been riding on the train without a good wash! At the same time, I felt I was a resident of the nursing home depicted in the book and wanted to have a good meal myself.  Excellent book, one of the best reads of my adult life. It will definitely stay with me a long time.

I'm not one to read historical pieces, mostly because I don't think I'll relate to the people and times, but this book is an exception. An exceptional exception! I loved "Water for Elephants." Tragedy, mystery, adventure, humor and romance -- this book has it all. This is the story of a young man who finds himself working as a veterinarian for a traveling circus during the Great Depression era, but it's really so much more. So, step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and enjoy this masterpiece!

For me, this book reminded me of being a little kid.  I could picture myself sitting at the foot of my grandfather's bed as he told me stories of his youth and the adventures that came with it.  I was instantly transported to the 1930's and to the world of the traveling circus.  The author wrote with such clarity and viviid realism, that I was shocked when I later read that at the time she started writiing the novel, she has never been to a circus.  This novel is beautiful and moving, and certainly one that I will pass along to others.

This was a fast, enjoyable read on many levels.Jacob narrates the story, and we switch back and forth between his current age of "ninety of ninety three" and the seven years he spent working in the circus.  In the beginning of the story, I found switching between the present and past a bit jarring, but I thought it worked out well in the end.There is a line in the book, "'The whole thing's illusion, Jacob,' he says, 'and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's what people want from us.  It's what they expect'".  I thought this was a great way to summarize the story because it shows the illusion the circus performers put on, but gave you behind-the-scenes details into everyday life in a circus, and what it takes to create the illusion.Warnings: There are several sex scenes, which I didn't think were required to tell the story.  Also, there is a lot of what would be considered animal cruelty in today's standards.  Since this is set in 1930s, I believe it is realistic to what circus animals probably endured.

I had heard so much talk about this book but I wasn't that impressed or intrigued. It gave me a glimpse into how hard a life the circus folks had and gave me the feeling it was the place you ended up when you had no place else to go. Definitely took the glamour out of my fascination with circus'. I am glad I read it, it wasn't a waste of time but it just wasn't as good as I expected.

I was rather disappointed with the way some of the sordid details took away from an otherwise interesting story line.  I really liked the "backstage" peeks into the real life of what being on the road (or on the rails) could be like. And the general story line was very interesting. Not totally my cup of tea, but perchance my high expectations going in didn't help. Keep your expectations a bit lower & it may even be more enjoyable for you!!!

This story feels magical, while containing it's fair share of hard-hitting reality. It's a depression era story of a lost soul joining a traveling, American circus. It reads like a memoir of the story's main character, Jacob. The story begins in a modern day setting, where you meet Jacob as an elderly man, living in a retirement home.A circus is setting up just across the street from Jacob's retirement home, and the whole place is buzzing about it. It brings back Jacob's memories of his time traveling around the country with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. As a young man, he worked as their veterinarian.Jacob's relationships with the animals in the circus, as well as the crew members and performers are my favorite aspects of this novel. The author reveals that many of the most entertaining stories and plot twists concerning the animals were based on real occurrences. The author really did her homework, and it shows. The story line in endearing and entertaining.

Water for Elephants had a slow start for me, but I was soon dragged into the story, full force. It is apparent that this is a fully researched tale by the author, and you become truly immersed in the time period, what it was like to be part of circus, and just how greatly and entertaining these shows were at the time.As an employee at an independent resident home, I greatly enjoyed the back and forth between the old and young Jacob.  The situations the elder Jacob went through while at the nursing home, were really poignant and beautifully written (albeit, sad). You really felt for Jacob, and it was a bird's-eye-view on what it is like to age as you feel the same mentally and yet your body betrays you, no longer being able to keep up with your needs and desires.The characters were really fleshed out, especially August.  Even Rosie seemed like an actual person herself. The interactions of Jacob with the animals were really touching, especially because a lot of it touched Jacob's inner monologue about many things but also of his passion for taking care of these creatures.The relationship between Jacob and Marlena rang true for me, and were a bit reminiscent of the two lead characters in Nicholas Sparks' "The Notebook," but BETTER!I absolutely adored the ending, it was whimsical and inspiring. There is nothing better than finishing a story and feeling content with the journey you just undertook. You will most assuredly feel this as you complete this novel.I would definitely recommend this all encompassing story. It's not a mere love story, but the chronicle of one person's life, love and his insistence on not resigning himself to growing "old."

I loved this book set during the depression in a third rate circus, The Benizini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  The book is told through the eyes of 90 (or 93) year old Jacob Jankowski, as he recounts the events of that fateful year of 1931.When Jacob Janowski's parents are killed in a car accident just before his graduation from Cornell veterinary school he runs away and somehow ends up working for the Benzini Brothers circus after they learn he is almost a doctor. The harshness of both the ever encompassing depression and circus life is brought vividly to life. We meet the side show `freaks', the stars, the roustabouts and rubes and come to care for many of them, especially Walter, the educated dwarf.  The story centers on Jacob and his falling in love with the beautiful star of the equestrian show, Marlena, who is married to the questionably sane August who is the animal trainer.  It also involves the wonderful elephant Rosie, who is brought in as the star of the menagerie, but seems to have her own ideas about that.The ending is incredibly poignant and brought a smile to my face, as it brought the whole story full circle. I really loved this book.

Never having been particularly interested in all things circus-y, I put this book back on the bookstore shelf more than once. But an Amazon review of another, quite unrelated novel referenced this book so I picked up a copy. Really glad I did. This is a well-paced novel that doesn't fall into the trap of doubling as a documentary on the early twentieth century circus trade. It is engaging, romantic, with sufficient drama and excitement to keep the pages turning over well into the night. Maybe at times a little cute, but a solid four-star effort.

Such great character and plot development, along with a few humorous and tragic surprises.  You can tell the author did a lot of research on the subject of the circus.  And the reflections of the 93 year old man are PRICELESS!  A must read for anyone wanting to read a fun story.

Alternating between times, prisoned in a nursing home, 90-something year old Jacob recalled his life in the circus.Life pretty much changed overnight for Jacob Jankowski.  Jacob dropped out of veterinary school.  He just had to take the last test before graduating.  However, his parents' sudden death changed all that.  Now, Jacob could have gone back and finished the test.  However, he felt guilty once he learned that there were no money left from his parents because they spent all they had to finance Jacob's schooling.By some strange turns of events, Jacob found himself riding with a traveling circus, one that aimed to be better than the Ringling Bros.  It's here that Jacob is made the circus veterinarian over the circus' animals.  However, Jacob is falling for the Jekyll/Hyde-ish ringmaster's wife.I don't know if it was a reading fluke or not but I just couldn't get into the book at the beginning.  I wanted to like the book because my friends were telling me how great it was.  I just couldn't get into it.  After about 100 pages and days later, it finally picked up for me.Overall, the story was interesting as it was something that you don't see often.  Plus, archived pictures at the end of some chapters made the book even more interesting.  I became so engrossed in the story that it looked like Jacob's adventures with the circus spanned over years when it actually spanned over weeks.  So, it was a good read but not one of my favorites.

My daughter has been asking me to read this book for years.  I resisted because I read the synopsis and thought "a story about a circus in the era of the great depression? Nah."  I finally downloaded it and gave it a go and couldn't put the book down.  Seriously this is one of the best books I've read in years!  I felt like I was right there.  The narrative shifts back and forth between old Jacob and young Jacob seamlessly.  I strongly regret waiting so long to read this book.  And for you Nook/Kindle lovers, this book is only $5 to download.  I would have paid full price.  It is a haunting story and often had me thinking of my own aging.  What will it feel like to be inside a body that is old and doesn't function like it used to, yet the mind still feels young?  I can't wait for the movie to come out in April.

This book was fun.  The old circus is always fascinating and fun.I read the book very quickly, which is unusual for me.  If you like fun easy books, then this is a good one for you.But this book is not literature, and will be forgotten soon, and won't be read in 10 years.  It does not compare with Amy Tan, who has written literature that will probably continue to be read for a hundred years.

I'm torn on my opinion about this book which I just finished last night.  I loved the parts where Jacob was old; it successfully portrayed the anguish and confusion anyone would feel when their independence, privacy, and basically their rights are taken away from them. I really felt it.  The story grabbed me right away and continued to be enjoyable and interesting through about half the book; then it deteriorated a bit after that.  All in all though I enjoyed the book and the characters and am not sorry I read it.  Definitely easy reading.Laura

I hesitated to pick up "New York Times Bestsellers", because most of the time I don't fully understand the hype around them, either they're just a mediocre book or they fall extremely short of the hype that surrounds it, this was not the case with Water for Elephants. Sara Gruen literally places you in the middle of a 1920's traveling circus and dosen't drop you off until the very last page. I felt like I was right along side Jacob and Marlena and the rest of the Characters in the novel.The story was breath-taking, and captivating, and the characters and even the animals were so easy to like and so different in their roles and I loved it. This is one of the first historical fiction novels i've read in a long time, at least that come to mind, and although I was apprehensive to start this, i'm so happy I picked it up when I did. I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie adaptation of this as it is currently in theaters now, and as a true book-lover must read the novel before I go see the movie adaptation of it!! I have high expectations for this film so we will see what I think, but so far i've heard good things.Water for Elephants is an absolutly delightful story, it covers everything a truly remarkable novel should have; love, crime, secrets, drama, etc. this book has it all!flag

A pleasant, quick read.  The circus details were nicely researched and its full of colorful characters.  I did, however, find the alternating time periods intrusive, and the plot sadly predictable.  I also wish the villain had been more complex -- although the author provides us with mental illness as an excuse, it seemed too convenient, and frankly, not quite clinically credible. A sweet ending, although perhaps a bit sentimental. All in all, not an original book, nor one that will stand the test of time, in my opinion, however, for all that, an agreeable way to spend the afternoon.

Sara Gruen spent months researching circuses that traveled by trains and they paid off in the realistic Water for Elephants that she turned into fiction. The novel begins with main character Jacob Jankowski, a 93-year-old man in a nursing home, when the circus comes to town. This begins his flashback of his time with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931.While it focuses on the cirucs, the novel weaves back and forth between a 23-year-old Jacob on the circus and present-day Jacob with his nursing home struggles.Jacob had never intended to end up on the circus, but once he does he is caught in a whirlwind of romance and drama. He has to learn the ropes of a struggling circus that can't always afford to pay its employees. Each character has his/her own unique qualities that make each seem as real and relatable as the next. Even the circus's animals take on personalities that make them seem real.After the great reviews I wanted to give it a shot and I had trouble putting it down. The novel has a little something for every kind of reader as it falls into multiple genres of mystery, romance and adventure. Gruen continuously surprised me through the last page. Each page was as compelling as the next. I would absolutely recommend this novel to everyone.

As a former circus performer, I really should have read Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants when it came out in 2006. As it turns out, I just finished it and quite simply, it's fantastic. Set in both present time and the 1920's, it tells the tale of young Jacob Jankowski's circus days: how he stumbled upon the spectacle, how he made himself useful, and how he found true love. Told through flashbacks of himself at ninety...or ninety three, a fact he keeps forgetting, you see how the circus life effected him and what became of him after his years under the big top.After leaving Cornell, Jacob made his way onto the Benzini Brothers most Spectacular Show on Earth, a not as good as Ringling Brothers, but still decent traveling circus. He became the show's veterinarian, watching over the lions, chimps, horses, and, of course, elephant. There, he meets a dazzling array of characters including Walter, the show's midget clown; Earl, the strong man; Uncle Al, the show's ringmaster and owner; August, the moody and arrogant animal keeper; and his wife Marlena, the lovely horse tamer and elephant rider that Jacob falls for.Accompanied by archived photos from the Ringling Circus Museum, the book accurately portrays the life of a traveling circus member, riding the train daily going from city to city, hoping the town is looking for an afternoon of entertainment. In a time when entertainment was scarce, the circus really was a legendary spectacle. Money was tight and the sleeping quarters were tighter. The performers were treated like Gods, but the workers were seen as slaves. But when you were living cent by cent, it was a job--and a good job at that.As a reader, you're wrapped up my Jacob's tale, following him through his four month stay with the Benzini Brothers. You cheer him on and fear for his life all at the same time. You become attached, friends. And the ending leaves you satisfied, fulfilled and content.Personally, I was disappointed that they didn't concentrate more on the acts, however that's a small complaint from an otherwise fantastic read. Even for those who have no interest or knowledge of the circus lifestyle will get something out of it. Because at one time we've all seen the show. We've all seen the clowns, the elephants, and the acrobats. We've all eaten the pop corn and cotton candy sold from the striped tents. And, really, at some point, we've all wanted to run away and join the circus.

I bought this book because it was rated so highly and it was a NaNoWriMo novel. Somehow I made it to the bit that describes the old man having a shower which is about a 1/3 the way through according to my Kindle progress bar. I don't know how. I found it so incredibly vulgar that I just couldn't keep going. I didn't even care enough about the characters or the story to skip to the last few pages to find out what happened. In fact, I wish I could erase what I did read from my head and gain back the time I wasted reading it.

Oh how I loved this book! The story is told by its main character, Jacob who is now confined to a nursing home, reminiscing about his time spent in the circus. It tells of Jacob's life travelling in a circus during the Depression and of the harsh conditions for the workers in during this time. There are so many great characters in this novel that have great depth to them, including Rosie the Elephant. This is much more than a novel about the circus, it has a great story that everyone should do themselves a favour and read! I'm looking forward to seeing whether the movie can capture just what a truly captivating story this novel tells. Highly recommended.

This book was an absolutely fantastic read. It is delicious and complex and gritty, with a fresh and intriguing storyline. The movie did not do it justice - they took an intelligent, R-rated book and turned it into a somewhat comedic PG-13 movie. You should definitely read the book before you even THINK about renting or buying the movie. It will definitely be a reading experience you won't soon forget.

I picked this novel up in the airport as I was waiting to get on my flight to Orlando, mostly because it is coming out as a movie and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  That's my general rule after all.  And I was sorely disappointed.In this historical novel, Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, has left Vetrinary school at Cornell after suffering the loss of his parents, who have died in a tragic car accident.  He learns fairly quickly that his father, also a vet, was heavily in debt and actually died owing money.  So Jacob leaves school and his home and literally joins the circus. He travels cross country with the circus, acting as the show's vetrinarian and working under August, the head trainer and Uncle Al, the show's ringleader.  August is an interesting man, alternately charming and brutal.  He's also married to the beautiful Marlena, a performer, that Jacob forms a special bond with. This novel is about Jacob's relationship with Marlena, with the new elephant, Rosie and with Uncle Al.There are definitely several themes that are prevalent in this novel, which are super easy to pick out.  Water is for cleansing, for instance and the train tracks are for choosing a life path.I was not impressed by this book at all.  The themes were easy to spot and the ending was just as easy to spot.  The characters were shallow and one dimensional and I found myself annoyed with them more often than I was intrigued by them.  I just didn't really like it - I kept expecting it to get better and it didn't. It was a complete and utter failure.

I have never been a fan of the circus, but I do enjoy historical fiction, so I gave this one a try. I was skeptical at best when starting. The story is mildly interesting, entertaining,and entirely predictable. The characters were shallow, not well developed, but the story moves along quickly enough so this is not a big distraction. An earlier reveiwer summarized the book as "melodramatic" and I completely agree. It is like popcorn; light, fluffly, easy to digest and quickly forgotten. Not a bad way to spend a rainy weekend -- if there is nothiing on TV.

I just finished this book, and oh my word, what a fun, very quick read :-)  The story was wonderful and I loved the back and forth from the "old" Jacob to the "young" Jacob, the the past reality, to the current reality.The detail of the writing was so descriptive that I felt like I was in the hobo "city" or seeing the high trestle that Walter & Camel were thrown off of. It was just an amazing story, I'd suggest it to anyone, at any age.

This book will not change your life.  You will know everything that is going to happen.  I learned a bit about early circus life.  I learned a bit about how Depression impacted families and choices.  The best part was the view from the patient on life in a nursing home.  Other than that, it was entirely pure pleasure.I don't even know exactly why I like this book so much- it was such an easy read, it almost felt like a Danielle Steele novel, but there was more to it- it truly felt like drinking a warm cup of cocoa on a cold night.I read the negative reviews because I couldn't figure out how someone could not like this book.If you are looking for a life altering literary experience this isn't it.  If you are looking for a nice summer read that is a bit more substantial than chick lit, this is a good choice.  We read it in our book group and to be honest, there wasn't a lot to discuss, despite the controversial topic of circuses and nursing homes.  It was more of a love fest of how nicely the book was written.I recommend it.

I absolutely loved this book. The descriptions of the circus, the towns, and the train travel with all the animals seemed so authentic. However, I thought that canceling several shows and rushing west to buy an elephant and book someone for a sideshow seemed to be stretching things a bit. The expenses to feed all the animals and the employees would have been huge. I kept thinking this would have been handled by having either Big Al or one of his managers travel alone and make the transaction while the show went on back East. Other than that part, though, I was completely drawn in. I thought Jacob and Marlena made a wonderful couple. Marlena, by the time she met Jacob, already needed rescuing. And Jacob was a gentleman, who responded not only to her beauty and talent, but to her need for rescue. It's not surprising to me that they quickly fell for each other. My other favorite characters were Walter, a dwarf, and Rosie, the elephant.The circus part of the book was set in 1931, a time when people would take just about any job and put up with a lot of abuse to keep it if they had to. This helped to make some of the events more interesting and believable. The rest of the story is told by the 93-year-old Jacob and the author did a superb job of portraying the world from the point of view of someone who's in a care center and isn't always allowed to make his own choices. The switches back and forth between the two Jacobs were flawless and really help make the story. The ending was perfect, exactly what I would have wished for Jacob. Highly recommended.

If you're looking for a book that's entertaining and different, Water for Elephants is perfect.  The novel is about Jacob, a 93 year old man living in a nursing home evaluating his present condtion and reflecting on his past. Through flashback, he tells of his experiences as a caretaker and sometimes veterinarian of the animals of the Benzeni Brothers Circus. There is adventure, suspense, murder, and even a love story. While it is fiction, Gruen does an excellent job of researching the history of the circus which results in an interesting and insightful look into what it means to be a part of a traveling circus.

Water for ElephantsSara GruenA 90-year-old man--or is he 93?--narrates the story of his one summer as a veterinarian with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth during the summer of 1931 in Depression-era America.  Jacob Jankowski resides in an assisted living home with other elderly people, many of whom require more medical attention than he.  He is quite mentally astute for his age, yet because of his age, most of the people in charge of the facility treat him as mentally incompetent, all but Rosemary, a forty-seven-year-old nurse, who treats him and the rest of the patients/residents with the loving care, dignity, and respect they deserve as human beings.  But she is moving away and will be quitting the facility, which in the end leads to Jacob's decision to continue his life--what little he may have left--in dignity.There is a circus that has come to town.  It is so close to the facility that the big tent and other goings on can be observed from the window.  All of the old people reminisce about their experiences in their youth going to the circus.  One old man and a newcomer to the home, Mr. Joseph McGuinty, who is considerably younger than Jacob, brags about having worked in a circus, carrying "water for elephants."  Jacob becomes upset because he knows Mr. McGuinty is lying to attract the attention of the other residents; and the memories of the truth of his past life are triggered.Flashback to young Jacob Jankowski, a veterinary student at Cornell University in his last year!  Just before he is scheduled to take his final exams, after which he will graduate and receive his degree, both his parents are killed in an automobile accident.  After their burial and after learning the truth of his financial situation, Jacob is unable to focus.  He leaves the exam room and leaves Cornell.  Distraught, he leaves with only the clothes on his back and no money in his pocket.Because of the Depression, people were unable to pay for his father's services; and his father, also a veterinarian, worked for people even though they could not pay him, taking whatever they could give him--eggs, chickens, whatever they had.  Therefore, his parents had nothing to leave their son but debts.  To pay his tuition, the house had been mortgaged.So not being able to focus, he leaves without ever putting pen to paper.  Without aim or destination, he walks and soon finds himself beside the railroad tracks, when along comes a train.  Like a hobo, he hops the train with no idea where he is going.  He soon learns this is a circus train and is not tossed off it because the Benzini Brothers, whose circus it is, discover he is a veterinarian; and his services are badly needed.Working as a veterinarian that summer leads to all kinds of experiences, tantamount among them which are falling in love, getting married, and eventually working with the circus's one elephant.After his summer with the Benzini Brothers, he is hired by Ringling Brothers.  He, along with his wife and his growing family, spends seven years as a circus veterinarian.  He then becomes the veterinarian for the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.  His seven years experience with exotic animals and his degree, in addition to bringing an elephant with him, insures him the job when the former vet suddenly dies.Jacob, ninety years old--or is he 93? he asks himself, recognizing that his old age has caused some memory loss--struggles to hold onto his humanity and his dignity as long as he can.  It is he who in his reminiscences about his circus life, his friendships, and his deep love for his wife narrates the story.  The reader falls in love with Jacob and develops an even greater love and respect for "old folks."  Sara Gruen's novel awakens the reader to the often mistreatment of and disrespect for the elderly, evoking empathy in their cause.  Especially hurtful is seeing how their own families, their own children, mistreat them, or forget about them.  Old people are still human beings.  In many cases, their bodies may be broken, their hands and fingers gnarled, but in all cases, there is a brain inside their heads as Jacob proves.  In having Jacob tell his story in Water for Elephants, the author informs us of this and reminds us of the fact that we will grow old someday.  At the same time Sara Gruen affords us a moving and delightful read--so do not be misled by the title.

Where to even start with a review of this book...  There are over 2,600 reviews already and I doubt I'll be able to add anything new or groundbreaking.  My mom and my friend have been trying to get me to read Water For Elephants for the past couple of years, but I've resisted.  I didn't want to read this book for a few reasons, namely - the subject matter (a traveling circus) didn't really excite me, the idea of an old man telling the story in a sort of flashback manner reminded me too much of The Notebook (of which I only saw the movie), and most of all, I didn't want to read this story because I absolutely adore animals and I knew there would be parts about abuse that would be difficult for me to read.  But now that the movie has come out, I knew it was time to give it a go.  Books are always so much better than movies and I wanted to check this novel off my list before it possibly became tainted by Robert Pattinson's portrayal.... just in case.  :)If, like me, you also have these reservations - don't let them stop you.  Yes, the story is rather sad in parts, and it will make your heart break, but it's so much more.  It took me a while to really get in to the story, but I absolutely tore through the last 200 or so pages.  It's not so much a love story as it is a life story.You can really tell that the author did her homework.  There are vivid, graphic descriptions of everything and you feel like you're right there with these characters.  The true mark of a good writer (at least for me) is when they can create characters that you hate and abhor so much they can actually make your skin crawl even after you've read the last page.  This author did that - and with more than one character.Overall, it was a fantastic story and I highly recommend it!

This book was a SPLENDID, completely absorbing read!  I kept thinking I was reading a screenplay (although this didn't bother me, I did note it).Cornell-educated Jacob Jankowski looks back upon and retells the story of what became his unlikely life as a Circus Veterinarian. Sara Gruen makes the characters jump off the page in her writing.  There are villians, heroes, sequined angels, kind-hearted drunks, big hearted dwarves, and smart, quirky animals.  In all, a virtual smorgasboard of entertainment that transports you to another, fascinating day and time. Set during Prohibition, the circus train and its dark,frightening contents rumble from town to town holding the lives of hundreds of men, and us readers, in the balance!The only criticism I have (and this is very minor), is that I found myself skip-reading over the parts about Jacob in the nursing home.  While I valued being able to get this perspective, (and see that just because you are old and it may LOOK like you don't have all your faculties, you really do), I just couldn't stand but to get back to the main story.  I was chomping at the bit.Loved the book.  Loved the ending. Sad when it ended.  I should have made it last longer. Lots of fun!

Wonderful story telling. Easy read.Tells Jacob's story in two threads:- as a 93 year old living out his days in a nursing home struggling to maintain his sense of self and dignity.- as he starts his adult life which begins as a graduating animal vet but veers off instead as a lost soul who happens to fall into joining up with a train-traveling part of a Ringling Bros wannabe second rate circus in the 1930's America.You meet memorable characters in both story lines but the circus part is the focus of the book.- the hard bitten owner, Uncle Al, whose always just one step ahead of the law- the paranoid schizophrenic ring master, August- his young pretty wife, Marlena who performs a horse act- Kinko, the dwarf clown and his beloved terrier dog- many others who range from roustabouts, tent builders, animal caretakers, to hoochy cooch ladies, strong armed men who bully the other staff to keep order, cooks, candy vendors, etc.In the midst of this are the menagerie including a chimp, llamas, a panther, a lion, horses, camels, zebras and Rosie the elephant who, herself, is almost a separate story line.I got swept up into this book pretty rapidly and stayed buried in it up to the end which is both horrific and magical.

Water for Elephants is the first book in a long time to allow a reader to savor the pages while thirst for the next.  What more could you want out of a book???THe story revolves around the main character, Jacob Jankowski, and a part of his young adulthood.  During this period of time, Jacob must fend for himself as he migrated from what he believed would be a promised and lucrative life to a life of uncertainly and of poverty.Jacob stumbles into a lifestyle within and revolving around work in a traveling circus during the Great Depression era in the United States.Sara Gruen's writing brings alive every event and character very vividly; the setting simply demands only her very apt and transporting descriptions.Sara Gruen does transport the reader; the captivating read that feels as if you are just plunked down in the middle of Jacob's life.  The reader is absolutely the quintessential "fly on the wall".We not only observe but feel Jacob's pain, struggles, anxiety, happiness, discomfort, and grief.  She has managed to include the reader in her words.I enjoyed my role as a reader and can only hope that Gruen's other titles enable me to be transported yet again to another world that only Gruen can create.

A+ in my opinion, this is the story of circus life in 1931, two years after the beginning of the Great Depression. Jacob has just lost both of his parents several days before his final exams to become a veterinarian. When he then tries to take his exams, he freezes, and walks out of the room, thereby not getting his degree, but still having his education. He almost accidentally falls into a job with a traveling circus. It's a rough and uncertain life, but he comes to love and care for the animals. On the other hand, he doesn't do so well with some of the people. From the author's notes, I would say this is a pretty good re-telling of what actually happened between people/people and people/animals, although this is a fictional work. I suggest you come out of your box, as I did with this book, and read something other than your usual norm, be it mysteries, romances, or science fiction. Oh, and you will love Rosie!

I wasn't sure about this - circus and elephants and all. I was afraid it was going to be about animal abuse and very sad. Well - there is that, but it's so much more than that. You'll be transported to a different time and a location most of us will never experience - the backdoor view of a circus. Each character is so real, I felt I could regonize them.  And although I wasn't even around when the story took place - at least the early part, I could picture everything right down to the smells and sounds! The author has a terrific grasp of aging as well. Sympathetic but not syrupy. The aged Jacob is quite a character as he struggles with the indignities associated with 'assisted' living and the recollections of a past - recollections that he was just now ready to reveal at age 90 or was that 93?

I've been seeing this book for years at book stores and amazon website but for some reason I wasn't interested. The idea of a novel that takes place in a circus didn't seem exciting to me. Then, the kindle version of the book is offered with a great price and I reluctantly buy it and even more reluctantly read it. What a surprise... I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. The main character, Jacob, is brilliant especially at old age. I learned a lot about circus life and people. I thought the ending was marvelous. Now, I have to watch the movie and see how it compares to the novel. Very enjoyable read and highly recommended.

WE was terrific out of the starting blocks, vivid and well-researched, replete with interesting characters.  Along the way, though, it increasingly took on the feel of a creative writing exercise -- ever lighter on research, weaker on character development, and thinner on plot.  In the end, I found WE disappointing.  Like many historical novels by contemporary young authors, WE is only shallowly situated in its particular historical context (depression era, circus).  Every now and then the author tosses in a cliched reference to food lines to remind the reader of the historical moment; otherwise, nothing to suggest the landscape (literal and figurative) through which the Benzini Brothers train chugs ever onwards.  I emerged from WE with far less of a feel for circuses or society in the 1930s, or for aging and the elderly today, than I should have.  WE reads like an entertaining short story stretched to the breaking point.  There just isn't enough 'there' there...

I recently finished reading Water for Elephants.  The historical elements in this novel were carefully researched which made for a thrilling book.  I loved the way the story was told by an elderly man living in a nursing home and it bounced back and forth between timelines.  You fell in love with the grumpy man and you think about what the elderly actually feel like when they are forced to live in places like this. His story is touching and you really get to know all of the characters.  The elephant is a sweetheart and it's amazing how smart she is.  Great book and look forward to seeing the movie to see how well it was done.

"Water For Elephants" paints a runaway's story of joining the circus, interspersed with an old man's sad realities.  Bringing to life colorful characters that abound in the time of the train circus, Gruen strikes a balance between the despondency of the 1930s and the timelessness of hope and longing, both in the past and present.  An easy coming-of-age  must-read to curl up by the fire with!(I can't say I'm surprised that the book is being turned into a movie, though it'll be interesting to see if the movie manages to capture the poignancy of the old man's recollections...)

I couldn't wait to read and this book didn't disappoint.  The circus was an incredibly vivid background, as well as the life of Jacob as a senior in an old home.  The novel was well-researched and interesting!  The love affair was intense and problematic.  My bookclub of women 30-80+ all loved this book.

What kid hasn't wanted to run away to the circus? I wanted to be an acrobat at one point, swigging around high up in the sky. I don't think I ever really considered the repercussions of such a life though-always moving around, having to live with who you work with weather you like it or not, constant work...now it sounds more hard than fun to me.But Jacob Jankowski never really had a choice in the matter. Emotionally wrecked and financially bereft when his parents die in the great depression, Jacob hops on a train and ends up in the middle of the Benzini Brothers most spectacular show on earth. With his status as a (not graduated but) Cornell trained Vet, Jacob is hired on to see to the shows animals.Its decent work, but hard. And Jacob's boss August only makes it harder with his mercurial temperament and his very beautiful wife, one of the circuses star performers-who might like Jacob a little too much. But it's an arrangement Joseph can live with-until Rosie comes along.Every circus needs an elephant right? And Rosie becomes Jacob's. As circus life becomes more and more perilous-Can Jacob get out with his friends, animals and possible love of his life alive and intact? Come to the show and find out?"Water for Elephants" is a fantastic little gem of a book. The writing is marvelous, engaging, funny, sad-it's perfect really, except for one thing. And how could one fail to read the book after reading the prolog? There is no doubt this is an author to watch because she is going places!Just one problem-the disease that August is eventually unveiled as having is completely wrong for the symptoms he was exhibiting. I doubt the author really researched it or she would know that. It didn't bother me too much but for people who are suffering from or love those who really are paranoid schizophrenic it could be seen as stupid and offensive.But still, five stars.So step right up folks! Admission for this five star show is only the price of a good book.

A very well-written piece of literary fiction that is not easily forgotten.  I picked up the novel because of its great reviews and my disdain for the circus and inhumane treatment of circus animals, but ended up loving it because of a very engaging plot and my great affection for the main character in particular.  This novel is SO much more than a great story of Depression-era circus workers and performers; that simply lays the very interesting foundation. The ending was the best I've read in a long time and brought the novel full circle.  I look forward to more books by Sara Gruen!

I had no desire whatsoever to read this book until I saw a trailer for the movie. The tailer caught my eye and since books are always better then the movie I took a chance and found that I thought it was a great story. The story felt real. It's a very believeable read and I liked that it wasn't sugar coated. It held my interest and taught me a lot about circus life in that time period. The ending completely caught me off guard. Water for Elephants is a story that will stay with me forever. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading!

Jacob Jankowski is 90 or 93 years old - he can't remember -- living in curmudgeonly isolation in a nursing home where he reminisces and dreams of a time in his youth when he was an uncertified vet with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth traveling circus in the 1930s.  Uncle Al, the unscrupulous and chiseling owner, runs a tight train.  He has thugs who throw non-productive and trouble-making employees off the train to their deaths in a practice known as "red-lighting."  He also buys down-and-out circuses and, in one such act, acquires Rosie the Polish speaking elephant, who is smarter than anyone but Jacob knows.Jacob is the only person in the book who has a handle on a moral compass and as his reward he spends most of the novel beaten, broken, concussed, bleeding, swollen and hung over.  He is the self-appointed Protector of the Downtrodden who makes a dangerous mistake: he falls in love with Marlena, an animal act performer who is married to the brutal August, the menagerie supervisor.  His cruelty to animals and his violence are probably due to paranoid schizophrenia.  It is enough that he terrorizes everyone in his life and every animal, too.Jacob is forced to bunk in the horse car with the Shakespeare-reading Walter, aka "Kinko," a dwarf who is devoted to the Jack Russell terrier that is part of his act.  As the train carries the circus across the US, the lives of the performers and workers intertwine, relationships and loyalties are tested, and Jacob becomes a hero through simple humanity to Camel, a drunken laborer who is poisoned by drinking Jamaica ginger.The best scene in the entire novel is the descriptive passage of Marlena performing with her horse team and with Rosie, the elephant in her pink sequined costume.  Gruen manages to humanize people who really seem to be populating a fairy tale for adults.  Not a great book, but a diverting one.  Gruen seems to specialize in animal stories.

The book had me captured within the first page and I didn't put it down until I was forced to, or until I got to the end.If you're looking for something that you can read fairly quickly and be greatly entertained, you need to read this book. It's more than well worth the time.

Just finish reading this last night around 1 A.M.Good BookOne of those stories told by going back and forth between past and present. I love books written that way.Anyway the story is about a young veterinary student who falls into terrible misfortune and with few options joins a travelling circus, The (unscrupulous) Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Time period is in the 1920's or 30's, during The Great Depression. Narrated by an old man, 90 or 93 he says. Who is (unhappily) living out his days at a nursing home. Ah but he wasn't always an old man.The book appears to have been carefully researched and many of the characters and incidents are based on actual people, animals and or occurrences in circus of times past.At times funny, sad, heartbreaking yet hopeful this one will stay with me for a long while. I highly recommend it.

This is a best seller and has been lauded by many as an accurate portrayal of circus life in the 1930s.  Perhaps this is true.I loved the narrator, an elderly gentleman who is living in a nursing home.  I related to his upsets about the way he is being treated and understood his desire to get himself to the circus which has pitched its tent across the street from the home.  I felt empathy of this old man and felt the several chapters relating to his present life were done well.Through his voice we learn his story in flashback and most of the book takes place in this circus in the 1920s when the old man was young.  As the fresh-faced new kid, he's a stereotype.  And so is the woman he falls in love with.  Problem is that she's married to the ringmaster.  How this all turns out is mildly interesting, especially the parts about the animals, but I kept hoping the book would get better and I would feel some empathy for someone.Therefore, while this book has a few good moments, I can't even give it a lukewarm recommendation.

This is a very good book. It may be slightly over hyped, but it certainly deserves of most of the praise it's receiving. Water for Elephants is a moving tale about circus life during the depression era with quirky characters and complex emotions underlying the character's actions. It's uniquely told from the perspective of one character at two different stages of his life; Jacob at 20 and again when he was 93 and living in a nursing home. The story moves seamlessly between these two timelines and although I was more intrigued by the introspective old Jacob, the complexity and volatility of young Jacob also captured my attention, just on a different more concrete level. The book touches on what's important at different phases of life. The story is sweet, tragic and entertaining and the emotions that surface range from sad and lonely to happy and in love. In short, the story is haunting and brings to light the strong bond that develops between man and animal and shows the true meaning of friendship. An excellent selection for those who enjoy a good character driven story.

This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It had excellent character development and I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction.  Since hearing about the dreadful Hartford circus fire from my mother (who had friends perish), I have always found it to be such an interesting topic.  This bridged the gap from story to reality by referencing some of the real aspects of the circus by utilizing that backdrop with an interesting storyline.  I cannot wait until the next book!

It took me a couple of chapters to get into this book.  Having borrowed the book at the recommendation of a friend, I had no preconceptions.  I started reading and wondered if it was a dreary book about life in a nursing facility. When my friend asked about returning the book, I ordered an audio version so that I would not have to admit I could not get interested in the story.  I can almost always get through an audio book on my commutes to work.  The book quickly became an engrossing story.  I was cheering for the animals!  The mal treatment some of them received was very hard listening.  The one criticism I had, was Jacob's naivete.  Could he not figure out he was putting his friend's, and his own life, in danger?  I would have found him more attractive had he been more discerning.  As it was, I would not have been surprised had Marlena really not been attracted to him.  Also, I wondered if a talented circus performer such as Marlena was, would not have had to start very young instead of at the age of 17 when she left home and married August.  The ending?  for the circus it was terrific!!  But for Jacob at 93... found it less than realistic!

This audiobook was so well done! Two different readers provide for the voices of the man at 93, living in a rest home and his 23 year old self in memory. Alternate chapters keep the reader torn between hearing the story of Jacob and his experiences with a circus during the depression and his later self coping with another type of depression as he deals with a worn out body and his limited life as he waits to die. Anyone with compassion for older people will find this story heart wrenching and enlightening at the same time. Excellent!

The last novel I read and reviewed was also about animals but this could not be more different and after struggling to get into the last one, I loved this from the minute I picked it up and found it to be an exceptional read. The authors love of animals and the tremendous research she did for this novel make it not only a fascinating portrayal of life, ugly and vibrant in the American circus of the 1930's but a beautiful and tender love story. I had never even heard of circus trains until I read this either and learning a little something when I read also appeals to me.The title had been on my wishlist for awhile so I was delighted to obtain a copy recently and wanted to get on with reading so that I can see the film, which has been recommended to me.Since seeing elephants up close in Thailand, I also have more understanding of just how intelligent they are. Wonderful creatures which will treat humans well if they are given the respect they deserve. Sara Gruen portrays the nature of the elephant perfectly, for me Rosie was the real protagonist of the novel. The novel is told as two separate but connected stories, as well as being immersed in the circus world, we are also given an inside view of a home for the elderly where the hero of the story Jacob is now living. Again the author has done her research as the scenes in the nursing home were poignant and all too familiar to me in many ways.When the novel starts Jacob Jankowski is in his nineties and living in a nursing home and the imminent arrival of the circus in town revives some very stirring memories for the old man and it is these that are told in the other storyline.It is the American Depression and when Jacob's parents die while he is studying veterinary science at university, he discovers that they were in dire financial difficulties and he cannot even afford to complete his studies. Confused and bewildered with no plans for his future he finds himself hitching a ride on a circus train and in that moment his whole life changes. By the following morning he finds himself working for the travelling circus and by that evening he has met and fallen for the woman who will for evermore be the love of his life. Marlena, the star performer, however the love should remain unrequited as she is married to August the strangely mad animal trainer. Of course it is not long either before he also meets my particular favourite, Rosie the elephant. Whilst struggling to survive in the world of this second rate travelling circus this young couples love overcomes obstacles that you can not begin to imagine.The two stories are ultimately woven together but to find out just how you will have to read for yourself. I highly recommend you read this if you have not already done so. I think most avid readers will find something they like about this one.

What a terrific read! Water for Elephants has been lauded as a "great pick for summer", but this book is so much more. It has a depth and a substance to it that you don't usually find in your typical "beach read". It's obvious that the author did her research into the time period (post-Depression America), and the subject matter (traveling circuses).  According to the author's note at the end of the book, many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events, culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers. As a result, Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative.The main character is a cantankerous, still-sharp 93-year-old man, and his frustration at being trapped in an old man's body is palpable. The story of his incredible life and adventures with the Benzini Brothers circus unfolds in a way that is emotionally wrenching, and yet flashes of good humor pervade throughout. The characters are richly drawn, and even the animals are given complex personalities that make them a pivotal part of the story. There is something in the novel for everyone: it is equal parts adventure, mystery, fictional memoir, love story, and historical account.I highly recommend this book!

Gary Jennings is an author that does an amazing job of researching and writing about post civil war circus life, so check him out (Spangle), but Water for Elephants is an engaging, interesting, horrifying and a "can't put it down" read, for sure.

The historical story was interesting and kept my attention, even though I think TOO MANY people here are giving Ms. Gruen too much credit.  Personally, I don't think she used enough historical fact and instead relied on a very formulaic plot-line that was very predictable, i.e. the love relationship, the MC and head of the animals will be foiled in the end, and the preposterous ending where our dear wonderful elephant kills the cruel animal director.  Too contrived for me.I can understand the popularity of this book.  I cannot understand why it's a runaway bestseller.

Picked up this book to read based on the fact it was a local Book Club's Selection.  Immediately was drawn into it and read it in a day.  Book is 331 pages and for me it read quickly.My opinion the book is that it is thought provoking and also educational - communicated through the day to day thoughts of a man now facing the day to day realities and drawbacks of living in an "Assisted Living" facility.Gruen is able to effectively weave a lot of bittersweet humor into her character and has also imparted quite a bit of history of the period of the Great Depression and also circus life.Read thru the ratings that were less than 3 star - guess it goes to show we all have different tastes.  The reviewer who stessed going back to the old classics made me remember dry, horrible, rambling selections that to this day I do not value.Water for Elephants goes beyond boy meets girl, falls in love with girl, walks into the sunset hand in hand.  The interjection of the character in  his later years keeps the book flowing and gives the reader a chance to develop empathy for the main character.The end is upbeat - seems a bit unbelievable - but then again it keeps the "spark" of the book burning bright.Looking forward to more reading from Sara Gruen.

This book is a glimpse into circuses and carnivals of the past, in all their sordid glory. I was as fascinated with the circus life as I was with Jacob's story.

Water for Elephants follows two alternating storylines: the first traces the veterinary career of Jacob Jankowsi, a Cornell dropout who finds work with a little-known circus during the Great Depression. The second sees Jacob years later as a bored, temperamental old man in a nursing home. Having nothing but time, the older Jacob slips in and out of memories, mentally revisiting his days with the circus.The main focus of the "circus" storyline is the love triangle between Jacob, the circus's equestrian director, August, and August's beautiful wife Marlena, a performer. Although they all start out as friends, it soon proves to be a disjointed friendship at best. Despite his charming exterior, August is a two-dimensional bully prone to violent rages. Jacob, on the other hand, is relatively sane, competent though naive, and shares a mutual passion with Marlena (also somewhat two-dimensional) for the circus animals.The story has potential. Honestly, what's a more romantic setting for a love story than the surreal world of the circus? Unfortunately, the circus merely serves as exquisite background scenery for the main drama, which turns out to be nothing more than a predictable love story between two cardboard characters I could honestly care less about. That said, it's still worth a single read just for the background material itself.
